		 <h1>Credits for Master of Mana</h1>
			The names below are the forum names in CFC, the largest modding community for Civilization IV.
			<h2>Master of Mana team</h2>						
			<ul>
			  <li>Sephi - <i>overall design/implementation</i></li>
			  <li>Graywarden - <i>Documentation</i></li>  
			  <li>Saathei - <i>(Translation - retired)</i></li>

			<h2>Work from other Civilization IV Modifications (mods)</h2>
			There is a lot of Art/code/lore from Fall From Heaven II used. So huge thanks to the Fall from Heaven team and everyone who contributed to it or one of its many modmods.  
			<br><br>
			Several Improvements to the User Interface were merged from the popular BUG (Better Unaltered Gameplay) Mod for Civilization IV. 
			<br><br>
			Modular XML Loading was taken from the World of Civilization (WOC) mod.
			<br><br>
			Performance tweaks were merged from the CAR mod.
			<br><br>
			And finally a good amount of Content was inspired or directly merged from several Fall From Heavon modmods, in particular Fall Further (FF)
			<br><br>
			A hopefully not too incomplete List of the people whose work helped to create this mod: 
			ADHansa, Ahwaric, Arctic Circle, Avahz Darkwood, Billyank, Blackimperator, Cephalo, Davidallen, Denev, Emporer Fool (and the whole BUG team), Esvath, Freya, Gekko, Goodgimp, jdog5000, Jean Elcard, Kael, killmeplease, MagisterCultuum, MatzeHH, Moctezuma, Mr. Genie, Neomega, Notque, Orlanth, OrionVeteran, Opera, Onionsolider, Ostar, Pep, Rystic, Seven05, Skyrenoctis, Solver, Snarko, stmartin, Tarquelne, TC01, Tholal, Till, Turinturambar, Valkrionn, Vehem, Vermicious Knid, Warkirby, Xienwolf, Zerzes			
			<h2>Work from Artists</h2>
			A lot of work is taken either from the Internet or other Civilization IV mods that do not have a complete Credit list, so unfortunatly I cannot provide one either. This modification can be downloaded for <b>free</b>, no money is made in any way by using your art. Still if you want to see your art removed from the mod or (hopefully you choose this) want your work being credited here please contact me, I'll greatly appreciate it.
			<br><br>			
			And last but not least thanks to Firaxis for creating Civilization IV and the team from CFC for providing the necessary infrastructure to the Civilization Modding Community.
