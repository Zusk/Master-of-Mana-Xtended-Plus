[H1]Background:[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Amurites have no ancient history, no glorious empire in the Age of Magic to harken back to or trace their lineage from. In terms of civilizations, the Amurites are newcomers on the world stage. Nevertheless, they are a force to be reckoned with, feared by some, and respected by all. Part of that respect stems from the tremendous magical power the Amurite armies command, but no small part of it stems from the incredible story of their genesis.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Amurites call themselves the Children of Kylorin. According to their own legends, the arrival of the archmage Kylorin saved the Amurite people from obscurity, or possibly extinction, during the Age of Ice. Not even the Amurites know exactly why Kylorin picked these people as his chosen folk, but they maintain that it was because of a particular strength of character.[PARAGRAPH:1]Whatever the reason, when Kylorin appeared he changed the fortunes of the tiny, struggling clan that had been the Amurites. For years he lived in their midst, taking new wives as his old ones died of old age or in childbirth, leading the Amurites to a level of organization and advancement unrivalled by any other nation in the Age of Ice. Generations came and went, but Kylorin remained a constant, working towards some arcane goal with the Amurites as his willing and joyous tools. Whether through magic or sheer force of will, he remained young throughout.[PARAGRAPH:1]Until, one day, Kylorin strode out of his home. His face had aged many years, terrible purpose shone in his once soft and kindly eyes, and a magnificent blade hung faintly glowing by his side. With no farewells and no apologies, he went forth into the icy wastes and never came back. Soon after, the Thaw began.[PARAGRAPH:1]He had, however, left behind a powerful gift: his children. Through the years there had been quite a few, and they all carried latent magical abilities. Though the advancement made during the guardianship of the immortal wizard started leaking away during the Thaw, Kylorin's powers remained. Throughout the years, the children of Kylorin intermarried with the rest of the Amurites, and the abilities spread, making the Amurites the civilization that is most magnificently in touch with the magical currents of Erebus.[PARAGRAPH:1]This link has affected every aspect of Amurite life. They run their nation like a great magical school, training as many of their young as possible in, at the very least, basic magic skills. Their schools are so famous, they even attract those with magical abilities from other corners of the globe to join their ranks. The archmages and headmasters of the schools and universities act like an aristocracy in a nation that does not really have one, wielding great political power beyond the walls of their institutions.[PARAGRAPH:1]As with any large collection of scholars, the Amurites are mired in scholarly bureaucracy, the most insipid form of administrative quagmire known to man. The archmages, like professors, are frequently involved in petty squabbles over obscure matters that develop into personal feuds. Positions and knowledge are jealously guarded and hard to obtain; potential rivals are stonewalled at every turn. It is easy to become a mage in the service of the Amurites, but it takes a shrewd, powerful and unscrupulous practitioner of magic to rise to the apex of magical power.[PARAGRAPH:1]Above all, the Amurites have come to worship magic for its own sake. Their fascination with all aspects of magic is so deep that they do not feel hindered by petty alignments and concepts of "good" and "evil." Any avenue of magic can be explored, but some branches, like necromancy, are governed by strict laws and regulations, in order to prevent abuse and disasters. Justice for a mage who ignores these laws and starts dabbling in the regulated branches without obtaining the necessary permission is merciless, final, and in keeping with their fascination with the uses of magic, rather spectacular. No possibility is left for a repeat offense.[PARAGRAPH:1]Since the Amurites do not feel themselves confined by the alignments most nations follow, they are treated with a healthy amount of distrust by good and evil civilizations. Evil civilizations dislike the regulation of the dark and chaotic spheres, good civilizations are worried that they are not forbidden entirely. While not specifically hated by any, they have trouble making truly close allies. However, they don't feel they need any. As long as they are left in peace to conduct their magical experiments, they are happy, and wise rulers respect that. Those few who have crossed the Amurites and felt the fire of their arcane might have no desire to repeat the experience. Many have not been left the option.</English>

[H1]Background:[\H1][TAB]
[TAB]Les Amurites n'ont pas d'histoire ancestrale, pas de glorieux empire de l'Age de la Magie auquel s'identifier ou s'affilier. En termes de civilisation, les Amurites sont des nouveaux venus sur la scène du monde. Néanmoins, ils sont une force à reconnaitre, craints par certains, et respectés par tous. Une partie de ce respect provient du formidable pouvoir magique que les armées amurites commandent, mais aucun petite partie ne vient de leur incroyable genèse.[PARAGRAPH:1]Les Amurites se nomment eux-mêmes les Enfants de Kylorin. Selon leurs propres légendes, l'arrivée de l'archimage Kylorin sauva le peuple amurite de l'obscurité, ou d'une possible extinction, durant l'Age de Glace. Même les Amurites ne savent exactement pourquoi Kylorin choisit ces gens comme son peuple élu, mais ils maintiennent que ce fut grâce à une force de caractère particulière.[PARAGRAPH:1]Qu'importe les raisons, lorsque Kylorin apparut il changea le destin petit clan s'en sortant difficilement qu'était les Amurites. Durant des années il vécu en leur sein, prenant de nouvelles femmes lorsque les vielles décédaient de vieillesse ou en couche, conduisant les Amurites vers un niveau d'organisation et d'avancement incomparable avec tout autre nation de l'Age de Glace. Les générations vinrent et furent, mais Kylorin resta constant, travaillant à un but arcane avec les Amurites comme outils volontaires et réjouis. Que ce soit par la magie ou une volonté d'airain, il reste jeune.[PARAGRAPH:1]jusqu'à ce qu'un jour Kylorin se précipita hors de sa maison. Son visage avait pris de nombreuses années,  une intention terrible reluisant dans ses yeux doux et enfantins et une magnifique lame pendant à son côté. Sans adieux ni excuses, il s'en alla dans les étendues glacées et ne revint jamais. Peu de temps après, le Dégel commença.[PARAGRAPH:1]Mais il laissa derrière lui un puissant cadeau : ses enfants. A travers les ans il y en eut quelques uns, et tous portaient un potentiel magique latent. Bien que les progrès accomplis durant la gérance des mages immortels commençaient à s'estomper durant le Dégel, la puissance de Kylorin subsistait. A travers les ans, les enfants de Kylorin se marièrent avec le reste des Amurites, et les capacités se répandirent, faisant des Amurites la civilisation la plus magnifiquement en phase avec les courants magiques d'Erebus.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ce lien affecta bien des aspects de la vie amurite. Ils dirigeaient leur nation comme une grande école de magie, instruisant le plus de jeunes possible dans, au minimum, les compétences magiques basiques. Leurs écoles sont si célèbres qu'ils attirent dans leurs rangs même ceux avec des capacités magiques du quatre coins du globe. les Archimages et les Doyens des Ecoles et des Universités agissent comme une aristocratie dans une nation qui n'en a pas vraiment, maniant un grand pouvoir politique derrière les murs de leurs institutions.[PARAGRAPH:1]Comme tout grand groupe d'érudits, les Amurites sont embourbés dans une bureaucratie scolaire, le plus insipide des bourbiers administratifs que connaisse l'Homme. Les Archimages, comme professeurs, sont fréquemment impliqués dans de mesquines disputes pour de sombres raisons qui développent des dissensions personnelles. Les postes et les connaissances sont jalousement gardés et difficile à obtenir : les rivaux potentiels sont entravés à chaque opportunité. Il est facile de devenir un mage au service des Amurites, mais cela demande l'aide d'un praticien perspicace, puissant et sans scrupules pour atteindre l'apex de la puissance magique.[PARAGRAPH:1]Par dessus tout, les Amurites en sont venus à vénérer la magie pour son propre intérêt. Leur fascination avec tous les aspects de la magie est si profonde qu'ils ne se sentent pas entraver par d'insignifiants alignements ou des concepts de "bien" et de "mal". Toute voie de la magie peut être explorée, mais certaines branches, comme la nécromancie, sont gouvernées par des lois et des réglementations strictes, afin de prévenir les abus et les désastres. La justice pour un mage qui ignore ces lois et commence à barboter dans les branches réglementées sans obtenir la permission nécessaire, est impitoyable, final, et restant dans leur fascination des usages de la magie, plutôt spectaculaire. Aucune possibilité n'est laissée pour une récidive.[PARAGRAPH:1]Parce que les Amurites ne sentent pas confinés par les alignements que la plupart des nations suivent, ils sont considérés avec une prudente défiance par les civilisations bonnes et mauvaises. Les civilisations du mal déteste la réglementation des sphères sombres et chaotiques, les civilisations du bien sont inquiétées qu'elles ne soient pas entièrement interdites. Bien qu'ils ne soient pas spécifiquement haïs par aucun, ils ont du mal à trouver des alliés véritablement proches. De toute façon, ils n'en éprouvent pas le besoin. Aussi longtemps qu'ils restent en paix pour mener leurs expériences magiques, ils sont heureux, et les sages dirigeants respectent cela. Les rares qui ont croisé les Amurites et senti le feu de leurs arcanes n'ont pas le désir de répéter cette expérience. Beaucoup n'ont pas eu cette option.</French>

[H1]Background:[\H1][TAB]	
Die gemeinsame Geschichte der Amuriten ist vergleichsweise kurz, es gab kein prächtiges Reich im Zeitalter der Magie, auf das sie zurückblicken oder von dem sie ihre Herkunft ableiten könnten. Im Hinblick auf andere Zivilisationen sind die Amuriten Neulinge auf der Bühne der Welt. Trotzdem sind sie eine ernstzunehmende Macht, die von manchen gefürchtet und von allen respektiert wird. Ein Teil dieses Respekts rührt von der gewaltigen magischen Kraft her, über die die Armeen der Amuriten verfügen, aber ein nicht geringer Teil davon ist auch auf die unglaubliche Geschichte ihrer Entstehung zurückzuführen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Amuriten nennen sich selbst die "Kinder von Kylorin". In ihren Legenden heißt es, dass die Ankunft des Erzmagiers Kylorin das Volk der Amuriten vor dem Vergessen oder gar dem Aussterben während des Zeitalters des Eises bewahrte. Nicht einmal die Amuriten selbst wissen genau, weshalb Kylorin ausgerechnet diese Menschen als sein auserwähltes Volk aussuchte, sie behaupten jedoch, dass es an ihrer Charakterstärke gelägen habe.[PARAGRAPH:1]Aus welchem Grund auch immer, als Kylorin erschien, änderte er das Schicksal des kleinen, ums Überleben kämpfenden Klans, der die Amuriten einst gewesen waren. Für viele Jahre lebte er mitten unter ihnen, nahm sich neue Gemahlinen, wenn eine seiner Frauen an Altersschwäche oder bei der Geburt eines Kindes starb, und führte die Amuriten zu einem Grad der Organisation und des Fortschritts, den keine andere Nation während des Zeitalters des Eises erreichte. Generationen kamen und gingen, aber Kylorin blieb eine feste Größe, während er mit den Amuriten als willige und freudige Werkzeuge auf ein geheimnisvolles Ziel hinarbeitete. Entweder durch Magie oder bloße Willenskraft blieb er die ganze Zeit jung.[PARAGRAPH:1]Bis Kylorin eines Tages seine Heimat verließ. Sein Gesicht war viele Jahre gealtert, schreckliche Entschlossenheit glänzte in seinen einst freundlichen und gütigen Augen und eine prächtige Klinge hing schwach glühend an seiner Seite. Ohne Umschweife und ohne Abschiedsworte schritt er vorwärts in die gefrorene Einöde und kam nie zurück. Kurze Zeit später begann das Große Tauen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Allerdings hatte er ein wertvolles Geschenk zurückgelassen: seine Nachkommen. Während all der Jahre waren sie sehr zahlreich geworden und alle besaßen verborgene magische Fähigkeiten. Obwohl der Fortschritt, der unter dem Schutz des unsterblichen Zauberers erreicht wurde, nun während des Großen Tauens langsam dahinschmolz, blieb Kylorins Macht erhalten. In den folgenden Jahren vermischten sich seine Kinder mit dem Rest der Amuriten und ihre Fähigkeiten verteilten sich unter ihnen, wodurch die Amuriten zu der Zivilisation wurden, die die beste Verbindung zu den magischen Strömen von Erebus herstellen kann.[PARAGRAPH:1]Diese Verbindung hat das Leben der Amuriten in jeder Hinsicht beeinflusst. Sie führen ihr Reich wie eine große magische Schule und unterrichten so viele ihrer Kinder wie möglich mindestens in den Grundlagen der Magie. Ihre Ausbildungsstätten sind so berühmt, dass sogar die magisch Begabtenen aus anderen Winkeln der Welt in ihre Klassen strömen. Die Erzmagier und Leiter der Schulen und Universitäten verhalten sich wie Aristokraten in einer Nation, die eigentlich keine Aristokratie kennt, und besitzen über die Grenzen ihrer Institute hinaus eine große politische Macht.[PARAGRAPH:1]Wie bei jeder Ansammlung von Gelehrten ersticken die Amuriten fast in akademischer Bürokratie, die geistloseste Form des administrativen Sumpfes, die die Menschheit kennt. Die Erzmagier sind wie Professoren immer wieder in kleinlichen Streitereien über unbedeutende Angelegenheiten verstrickt, die nicht selten in persönliche Fehden ausarten. Posten und Wissen werden eifersüchtig gehütet und nur schwer zu erringen; mögliche Rivalen werden immer wieder abgeblockt. Es ist einfach, als Magier in die Dienste der Amuriten aufgenommen zu werden, aber es bedarf eines gerissenen, mächtigen und skrupellosen Anwenders der Magie, um in die Höhen der magischen Macht aufzusteigen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Amuriten beten die Magie vor allem um ihrer selbst willen an. Ihre Faszination für alle Aspekte der Magie ist so stark, dass sie sich nicht an kleinliche Gesinnungen und die Konzepte von "Gut" und "Böse" gebunden fühlen. Jeder Weg der Magie kann erforscht werden, aber einige Zweige wie die Nekromantie werden durch strenge Gesetze und Regulierungen beschränkt, um Missbrauch und Unfälle zu vermeiden. Die Bestrafung für einen Zauberer, der diese Gesetze ignoriert und sich ohne die nötige Genehmigung in den regulierten Zweigen der Magie versucht, ist gnadenlos, endgültig und, in Einklang mit ihrer Faszination für die Anwendungen der Magie, auch ziemlich spektakulär. Die Möglichkeit eines erneuten Verstoßes wird gar nicht erst zugelassen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Da sich die Amuriten nicht durch die Gesinnungen beschränken lassen, denen sich die meisten Nationen anschließen, werden sie sowohl von guten als auch von bösen Zivilisationen mit einer gesunden Portion Misstrauen beäugt. Den bösen Zivilisationen missfallen die Vorschriften für die dunklen und chaotischen Sphären der Magie, während die guten Zivilisationen beunruhigt sind, dass diese nicht vollkommen verboten sind. Zwar werden sie von niemandem wirklich gehasst, trotzdem haben sie Probleme, wirklich enge Verbündete zu finden. Allerdings haben sie auch nicht das Gefühl, diese unbedingt nötig zu haben. Solange sie in Frieden gelasssen werden, um ihre magischen Experimente durchführen zu können, sind sie zufrieden und weise Anführer respektieren das. Jene wenigen, die sich mit den Amuritern angelegt und das Feuer ihrer magischen Macht verspürt haben, haben kein Verlangen danach diese Erfahrung zu wiederholen. Viele erhielten diese Möglichkeit gar nicht.</German>

[H1]Background:[\H1][TAB]
[TAB]Los Amurites no tienen una historia antigua, ni un glorioso imperio de la Edad de la Magia desde el que remontarse ni una línea de sangre que seguir. En términos de civilización, los Amurites son nuevos en el escenario mundial. Sin embargo, son una fuerza a tener en cuenta, temidos por algunos, y respetados por todos. Parte de ese respeto proviene del tremendo poder mágico de los ejércitos Amurites, pero tampoco es pequeña la parte que proviene de la increible historia de su génesis.[PARAGRAPH:1]Los Amurites se llaman a sí mismos los hijos de Kylorin. Acorde a sus propias leyendas, la llegada del archimago Kylorin salvó al pueblo Amurite de la oscuridad, y posiblemente de la extinción, durante la Edad de Hielo. Ni siquiera los Amurites saben exactamente porqué Kylorin optó por esta gente como sus hermanos elegidos, pero mantienen que fue por una particular fuerza de carácter.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sea cual sea la razón, cuando Kylorin apareció, cambió la fortuna del pequeño y afanado clan que era el de los Amurites. Durante años vivió entre ellos, tomando nuevas esposas cuando sus antiguas morían de vejez o dando a luz, llevando a los Amurites hacia un nivel de organización y desarrollo sin posible rivalidad de otra civilización en la Edad de Hielo. Generaciones vienieron y se fueront, pero Kylorin permaneció constante, trabajando por un objetivo arcano con los Amurites como sus herramientas deseosas y entusiasmadas. Ya sea por la magia o por pura fuerza de voluntad, él permaneció jóven a lo largo del tiempo.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hasta que, un día, Kylorin salió de su casa a zancadas. Su cara había envejecido muchos años, con un terrible propósito brillando en sus una vez suaves y joviales ojos, y colgada a su lado una magnífica espada brillando tenuemente. Sin despedidas ni disculpas, se fue decidido hacia las extensiones de hielo y nunca volvió. Poco después, comenzó el Deshielo.[PARAGRAPH:1]Había, sin embargo, dejado atrás un poderoso don: sus hijos.  Con los años han habido unos pocos, y todos ellos llevaban habilidades mágicas latentes. Aunque los avances hechos durante la vigía del hechicero inmortal empezaron a desvanecerse durante el Deshielo, los poderes de Kylorin permanecieron. A lo largo de los años, los hijos de Kylorin se entremezclaron con el resto de los Amurites, y las habilidades se propagaron, convirtiendo a los Amurites en la civilización más enormemente innata a la magia de Erebus.[PARAGRAPH:1]Esta línea ha afectado a cada aspecto de la vida Amurite. Dirigieron a su nación como una gran escuela de magia, entrenando a tantos jóvenes como fue posible hasta en las más básicas habilidades mágicas. Sus escuelas con tan famosas que incluso atraen a aquellos con habilidades mágicas desde otros rincones del globo para unirse a sus filas. Los Archimagos y Profesores de las Escualas y las Universidades actúan como una aristocracia en una nación que siquiera tiene una, manejando un gran poder político más allá de los muros de sus instituciones.[PARAGRAPH:1]Como una gran colección de escolares, los Amurites están atrapados en burocracia escolar, la forma más insípida de atolladero administrativo conocido por el hombre. Los Archimagos, como profesores, se envuelven frecuentemente en nimias disputas acerca de materias obscuras que terminan en feudos personales. Las posiciones y el conocimiento están celosamente guardados y difíciles de obtener; los rivales potenciales son desbancados a la mínima oportunidad. Es fácil convertirse en mago al servicio de los Amurites, pero requiere una práctica sagaz, potente y escrupulosa de magia para alcanzar la cúspide del poder mágico.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sobretodo, los Amurites han llegado a adorar la magia para su beneficio. Su fascinación por todos los aspectos de la magia es tan profunda que no se sienten atados por meros alineamientos y conceptos del "bien" y del "mal". Cualquier vía de la magia puede ser explorada, pero algunas ramas, como la nigromancia, son gobernadas por estrictas leyes y regulaciones, con el objeto de prevenir abusos y desastres. La justicia para un mago que ignora estas leyes y empieza a aficionarse a las ramas reguladas sin obtener el permiso necesario es implacable, definitiva, y en consonancia con su fascinación en los usos de la magia, también espectacular. No hay posibilidad para una ofensa repetida.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ya que los Amurites no se sienten confinados por los alineamientos que siguen la mayoría de las civilizaciones, son tratados con una saludable cantidad de desconfianza por las civilizaciones buenas y malvadas. Las malvadas discrepan en las regulaciones de las esferas oscuras y caóticas, y a las buenas les preocupa que no las hayan abolido por completo. Aunque no son odiados de manera específica por ninguna, tienen problemas a la hora de hacer verdaderos aliados. Sin embargo, no sienten la necesidad de ninguno. Siempre y cuando sean dejados en paz para conducir sus experimentos mágicos, serán felices, y los dirigentes sabios lo respetan. Aquellos que se interpusieron con los Amurites y sintieron el fuego de su poder arcano no sienten el deseo de repetir la experiencia. Algunos no llegaron a tener opción.</Spanish>

        <English>[PARAGRAPH:1]
As nation of performers and tricksters, Balseraphs excels in happiness and cultural achievement. They can use slaves to build various cages, increasing happiness and culture in the city. Even their Training Yard UB, the Arena, provides culture. This makes it easier for Balseraphs player to overwhelm neighbouring cities and flip them, making them join Balseraphs empire.

Balseraphs has good synergy with the Octopus Overlords, especially in pursuing Cultural victory. Balseraph OO is a culture powerhouse; with Dance of Ectasy, their cities will produce tons of culture per turn. Balseraphs also has good synergy with Slavers Quarter. Their unique unit, Taskmaster, can capture slaves but Slavery makes every Balseraph unit capable of capturing slaves. Slaves are valuable to build various cages and to rush production.

The main weakness of Balseraphs is their early military strength. Balseraphs start with mutated Freak, which can provide either great soldiers or awful ones. Clown is a weaker version of Archers and it's hard to defend cities using them. Until unlocking stronger units, the Balseraph player needs to be cautious against external threat.

[H1]Background:[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Kylorin was the greatest mage who ever lived, unrivaled in versatility or insight. There were some individuals, though, who surpassed him in raw talent. Jealousy was never a fault of Kylorin, even at his most depraved, and he sought out those with particular aptitude to take as his personal pupils. Perpentach was one of his students, a master of mind magic before he even knew it. He could control minds without even trying. Doing so frequently at a young age took a toll on his sanity. Kylorin healed his mind when he found him, and with Perpentach's unrivaled powers at his disposal, his increasingly dark empire never once faced the threat of revolt. Until Kylorin himself saw what he, and by his hand most of mankind, had sunk to. Kylorin tried to reform Patria, but doing so brought its ruin, for the most powerful people on the planet, his pupils, had been molded by him into cold-hearted instruments of control and oppression, and few of them wanted to take the limits their master then tried to impose. When Kylorin went to stop Perpentach, he almost lost his life for it. He did the only thing he could do to survive, stunning Perpentach by undoing his previous work, and Perpentach's mind was flooded with all the thoughts and personalities he had acquired with his magic. [PARAGRAPH:1] Unwilling to kill the man he had corrupted, Kylorin locked Perpentach in the Tower of Eyes, a dungeon deep in the wastelands guarded by mindless golems. There he would have spent the rest of his mad days had it not been had for a circus caravan that wandered close enough for Perpentach to gain control. This was the start of the Balseraph nation, as Perpentach used the circus people to carry his mind to a nearby village and brought them under his control to free him from his prison. This would surely have led to another confrontation with his master, had not the Age of Ice intervened. Perpentach lasted the age by taking over the body of a young man when he aged, and he and the circus people and their descendants, either controlled by his magic or subdued by it, lasted that dire age by hiding from the Illian White Hand. When his old master freed the world from Mulcarn's grasp and warmth and prosperity returned to Erebus, Perpentach set out to rebuild his empire. His madness does not cripple him, but his realm is like no other, whimsical and deadly at once.

[H1]Background:[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Kylorin was the greatest mage who ever lived, unrivaled in versatility or insight. There were some individuals, though, who surpassed him in raw talent. Jealousy was never a fault of Kylorin, even at his most depraved, and he sought out those with particular aptitude to take as his personal pupils. Perpentach was one of his students, a master of mind magic before he even knew it. He could control minds without even trying. Doing so frequently at a young age took a toll on his sanity. Kylorin healed his mind when he found him, and with Perpentach's unrivaled powers at his disposal, his increasingly dark empire never once faced the threat of revolt. Until Kylorin himself saw what he, and by his hand most of mankind, had sunk to. Kylorin tried to reform Patria, but doing so brought its ruin, for the most powerful people on the planet, his pupils, had been molded by him into cold-hearted instruments of control and oppression, and few of them wanted to take the limits their master then tried to impose. When Kylorin went to stop Perpentach, he almost lost his life for it. He did the only thing he could do to survive, stunning Perpentach by undoing his previous work, and Perpentach's mind was flooded with all the thoughts and personalities he had acquired with his magic. [PARAGRAPH:1] Unwilling to kill the man he had corrupted, Kylorin locked Perpentach in the Tower of Eyes, a dungeon deep in the wastelands guarded by mindless golems. There he would have spent the rest of his mad days had it not been had for a circus caravan that wandered close enough for Perpentach to gain control. This was the start of the Balseraph nation, as Perpentach used the circus people to carry his mind to a nearby village and brought them under his control to free him from his prison. This would surely have led to another confrontation with his master, had not the Age of Ice intervened. Perpentach lasted the age by taking over the body of a young man when he aged, and he and the circus people and their descendants, either controlled by his magic or subdued by it, lasted that dire age by hiding from the Illian White Hand. When his old master freed the world from Mulcarn's grasp and warmth and prosperity returned to Erebus, Perpentach set out to rebuild his empire. His madness does not cripple him, but his realm is like no other, whimsical and deadly at once.

[H1]Background:[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1]Kylorin war der größte Magier, der jemals gelebt hat, er war unvergleichlich vielseitig und einsichtsvoll. Allerdings gab es durchaus einige Personen, deren Talent seines übertrafen. Eifersucht gehörte nie zu den Eigenschaften Kylorins, selbst unter den Verdorbensten suchte er sich diejenigen aus, die ein besonderes Geschick bewiesen, und unterrichtete sie als seine persönlichen Schüler. Perpentach war einer dieser Schüler, bereits ein Meister der Geistesmagie, bevor er es selbst bemerkte. Er konnte den Verstand anderer Menschen kontrollieren, ohne sich besonders anstrengen zu müssen. Da er dieses Talent bereits im frühen Kindesalter häufig einsetzte, forderte dies einen Tribut von seiner geistigen Gesundheit. Kylorin verschaffte seinem Verstand Linderung, als er ihn fand, und mit Perpentachs unvergleichlichen Kräften auf seiner Seite, sah sich sein zunehmend finsteres Imperium zu keinem Zeitpunkt der Gefahr einer Rebellion ausgesetzt. Bis Kylorin selbst erkannte, wie tief er und, durch seine Taten, auch ein Großteil der Menschheit gesunken war. Kylorin versuchte zwar, Patria umzugestalten, doch dadurch wurde das Imperium in den Untergang getrieben, denn die mächtigsten Menschen des Planeten, seine Schüler, wurden von ihm zu kaltherzigen Instrumenten der Kontrolle und der Unterdrückung geformt und die wenigsten waren bereit, die Grenzen zu akzeptieren, die ihnen ihr Meister plötzlich auferlegen wollte. Als Kylorin Perpentach stoppen wollte, verlor er dabei fast sein Leben. Er tat das einzig Mögliche, das er tun konnte, um zu überleben, indem er die Heilung, die er ihm damals zu teil werden ließ, rückgängig machte und Perpentach so lähmte. Perpentachs Verstand wurde von all den Gedanken und Persönlichkeiten überflutet, die er sich durch den Gebrauch seiner Magie angeeignet hatte.[PARAGRAPH:1]Da er nicht gewillt war, den Mann zu töten, den er verdorben hatte, kerkerte Kylorin Perpentach im Turm der Weitsicht ein, ein Gefängnis, das sich tief in den Ödlanden befindet und von Golems bewacht wurde. Dort hätte er den Rest seines geisteskranken Lebens verbracht, wäre nicht ein Zirkus gewesen, der nahe genug vorbeizog, damit Perpentach die Kontolle übernehmen konnte. Dies markierte die Geburtsstunde des Reiches der Balseraph, da Perpentach die Schausteller des Zirkuses benutzte, um seinen Verstand bis in ein nahegelegenes Dorf auszudehnen, das er unter seine Kontrolle brachte und durch dessen Bewohner er schließlich aus seinem Gefängnis befreit wurde. Sicherlich hätte dies zu einer erneuten Konfrontation mit seinem Meister geführt, hätte sich nicht das Zeitalter des Eises eingemischt. Perpentach überdauerte das Zeitalter, indem er den Körper eines jungen Mannes übernahm, als er selbst alterte. Er und die Zirkusschausteller und ihre Nachkommen, die entweder durch seine Magie kontrolliert oder von ihr unterworfen wurden, überlebten dieses magere Zeitalter, indem sie sich vor der Weißen Hand der Illianer versteckten. Als sein einstiger Meister die Welt von Mulcarns Würgegriff befreite und Wärme und Wohlstand nach Erebus zurückkehrten, machte sich Perpentach daran, sein Reich wiederaufzubauen. Sein Wahnsinn behindert ihn nicht, aber sein Reich ist wie kein anderes, launisch und tödlich zugleich.[PARAGRAPH:1]Es ist nicht einfach, den Meister der Geistesmagie zu täuschen, aber den Sheaïm ist Magie ebenfalls nicht fremd, so dass eine Spionin aus ihrem Reich in der Lage war, sich als Kurtisane an Perpentachs verrücktem Hof auszugeben. Sie wurde enttarnt, allerdings nicht bevor sie mit Perpentach ein Kind zeugte, ein Mädchen, das von Marionetten, Kobolden, Dschinns und anderen beschworenen Wesen gehütet und aufgezogen wurde. Keelyn versteht nur wenig von Sterblichkeit oder Moral, aber sie versteht sich auf mächtige Beschwörungen, was sie zu einer gefährlichen Unbekannten in der Politik von Erebus macht. Perpentach hat sie nie öffentlich als sein Kind anerkannt, wahrscheinlich wegen seines Wahnsinns oder vielleicht verfolgt er auch irgendeinen Plan.</German>

Bannor is a strong, huge empire. It focuses on military discipline and strength. Even their arcane units gain +2 strength from military techs, thus making acquiring military techs is a must for Bannor to research.

Each Bannor units start with armour of a kind, making them more durable than units of the same tier. They, however, require lots of yield, such as leather, metal or lumber. It is advisable for Bannor player to cultivate their units, focusing on quality rather than quantity. Of course, if need is arisen, Bannor can recruit cheap Fanatics to act as shock trooper. Beware that Fanatics have low defense!

Bannor has great synergy with the Order. They get extra unit: Cleric, a Disciple unit with Medic I-III, giving Bannor access to non magical healing rivalled only by high priests or Luonnotar.

However, Bannor following Order is difficult to develop magic. Order despises arcane research. Bannor adepts also do not start with one free promotion and do not gain XP by casting spells. Thus, it is advisable for Bannor player to either play low magic strategy, using limited spells and summons to help them win war, or deliberately ignore magic, only researching enchantments to help their empire's growth.
		
[H1]Background[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Bannor started with a handful of people, trapped in hell during the fall of Braduk but rescued by Sabathiel, an angel in Junil's service. In exchange for their salvation, the spirits bound themselves and their descendants to ceaselessly battle the forces of chaos and disorder. As Sabathiel led the honorable spirits forth into the light, they formed the vanguard in a devastating war against the Clan of Embers, even more powerful then than they are today. Throughout the entire Age of Rebirth the Bannor waged brutal and merciless war not only on the Clan, but on all who would not submit to law and order.[PARAGRAPH:1]Throughout this war of liberation and extermination, these heroes of an ancient age forged conquered, allied, and submitting tribes, cities, and nations into a human empire which, with the aid and guidance of Sabathiel, may stand firm even against the looming apocalypse, when unequaled evil is loosed upon Erebus. [PARAGRAPH:1]This continuing Holy War permeates every part of their society, leaving it almost totally militarized. For the Bannor, there is no clear line between religion, family, and politics. They apply a frightening religious fervor to the art of war, and their obsession with order makes even the peasant regiments among the best drilled of all the empires. All men are trained from childhood in the arts of war-hand-to-hand combat, archery, self defense, strength, and agility. Unlike most other societies, there are plenty of possibilities for rising through the ranks through bravery and skill, a fact which inspires as much if not more fighting fervor than the religious element.[PARAGRAPH:1]Because they need to be defended and ready at all times, outlying villages are more like forts, every farm is a small castle, the cities are huge garrison towns but also centers of trade, religion, and diplomacy. Few men are without scars from battle and the women are strong-willed and hardened. They know that the children they raise may one day be lost in battle, and they also know that one day the war may come to them. It is a rare woman among the Bannor that cannot handle a sword. [PARAGRAPH:1]A central part of understanding the fabric of Bannor society is understanding the split between estates and "free land." The estates are enormous tracts of land, almost sub-kingdoms, under the rule of an Order, a Family or one of those peculiarities of the Bannor: a Hereditary Order-a religious order with members exclusively from one clan. Centered on a stronghold or small fortified city, the main function of the estates is to provide the necessary resources to field one Order or Family division, the powerful and highly dedicated fighting forces that make up the feared backbone of the Bannor armies.[PARAGRAPH:1]The lion's share of the land in the Bannor empire is the "free land." The villages and cities that occupy and make a living off this land must, in addition to paying taxes and organizing their own defenses, provide a number of soldiers, fully trained and equipped, according to the wealth of the settlement. Although the Orders and Families are the spearhead and armored fist of Bannor armies, "free land" conscripts provide the bulk forces that are needed to carry a battle.[PARAGRAPH:1]By far the most numerous of the estate-holders, the non-hereditary Orders will take fighters from all across the world, all nations and races. Those deemed worthy in prowess and intelligence are taught in the ways and language of the Bannor and then join the fighting forces on the same footing as native Bannor.[PARAGRAPH:1]The hereditary Orders are in reality families that have founded or taken over control of an Order. All the major positions are held by and passed down from father to son, uncle to nephew, like any usual aristocratic title. It is one of the few options a rich non-noble family has of gaining an estate and the power and responsibility that comes with it.[PARAGRAPH:1]The noble Families all trace their lineage back to one of the spirits that Sabathiel set free. They use this holy heritage to legitimize their enormous power, and it is the reason the priesthood tolerates their existence and their meddling in the running of things. There are very few Families, but every one of them wields as much power and wealth as an Order. However, the priesthood keeps these secular powerhouses under careful and strict control, lest they attempt to change the fabric of Bannor society.[PARAGRAPH:1]The highly-trained and well-equipped men who fight in the professional divisions of the Orders and Families come from a variety of backgrounds and fight for any number of reasons: Some do it for money or status, some few do it for glory or personal revenge, but most do it because they truly believe they are on the front line of the war against Evil.[PARAGRAPH:1]As any Bannor priest could tell you, the war fought by the Bannor is far more complicated than a simple Good-Evil battle. The priesthood, under the guidance of Sabathiel (or so they claim) decide who is an enemy. Although they have yet to fight a civilization that conforms to some kind of law and sense of justice and compassion, few who can avoid it dare cross the Bannor, lest they be "damned" and added to the list of civilizations that must be taught to repent.[PARAGRAPH:1]The focal point of the entire Bannor Empire is their capital, centered around the Bannor Palace, The Halls of Sabathiel. Although still recognizably a garrison city, it is also a sprawling, international metropolis matched by few other cities in Erebus. This is where the Orders have their headquarters, this is where the Families meet to discuss affairs of state, and this is where people come to consult with the priesthood. People of all races flock to the city to swell the ranks of the Orders, the Halls of Sabathiel have a constant stream of visitors coming to pay tribute or ask favors of his priests, and the bazaars and markets attract traders from far and wide, catering to the needs of a multiracial, multinational and multicultural army and administration.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sabathiel, the mythical ruler of the Bannor, unwilling to set foot upon Erebus and break the letter or the spirit of the Compact, is said to reside deep within the recesses of his Halls, watching, guiding, teaching, and warding over the Bannor, urging them on but unable to physically manifest. He is a shadow king, never seen by his subjects but always a haunting figure, ever present in their consciousness. Their battlefield commanders are much more present figures to most Bannormen, Capria being the best example, who as a young girl led her people as they stepped from hell, and soon grew in honor and authority through the end of the Age of Ice and dawn of the Age of Rebirth.[PARAGRAPH:1]In this day, there are those even among the Bannor, and even more so among their enemies, who whisper that both Sabathiel and his original spirits are naught but legends invented by a militant priesthood looking for ways to legitimize their rule. Whatever the truth of the matter, the fact is that in the Age of Rebirth, the Bannor must rely on human flesh and cold steel, not angels and spirits, to bring Law to the dark corners of the world.</English>

[H1]Background[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1]Die Bannor entstanden aus einer Handvoll Menschen, die während Braduks Fall in der Hölle gefangen waren, aber von Sabathiel gerettet wurden, einem Engel in den Diensten von Junil. Als Gegenleistung für ihre Errettung schworen sie, ihre Seelen und jene ihrer Nachkommen dem unablässigen Kampf gegen die Kräfte des Chaos und der Verderbnis zu widmen. Als Sabathiel diese Seelen zurück in das Licht führte, bildeten sie die Vorhut in einem verheerenden Krieg gegen den Klan der Asche, der damals sogar noch mächtiger war als heute. Während des gesamten Zeitalters der Magie führten die Bannor nicht nur einen brutalen und mitleidslosen Krieg gegen den Klan, sondern auch gegen jene, die sich Recht und Ordnung nicht beugen wollten.[PARAGRAPH:1]In diesem Befreiungs- und Vernichtungskrieg schmiedeten diese Helden eines vergangenen Zeitalters aus eroberten, verbündeten und unterworfenen Stämmen, Städten und Nationen ein Menschen-Reich, das, mit Sabathiels Hilfe und Führung, sogar der heraufziehenden Apokalypse trotzen könnte, wenn das beispiellos Böse auf Erebus losgelassen würde.[PARAGRAPH:1]Dieser stetige Heilige Krieg durchdringt alle Bereiche ihrer Gesellschaft, die in Folge dessen nahezu vollständig militarisiert ist. Für die Bannor gibt es keine klare Trennung von Religion, Familie und Politik. Sie betreiben das Kriegshandwerk mit einem erschreckend religiösen Eifer und ihre Besessenheit von Befehlen macht sogar die Bauernregimenter zu den bestausgebildeten aller Reiche. Alle Männer werden von Kindesbeinen an in der Kriegskunst unterrichtet - Nahkampf, Bogenschießen, Selbstverteidigung, Kraft und Schnelligkeit. Im Gegensatz zu den meisten anderen Gesellschaften gibt es viele Möglichkeiten, durch Mut und Geschick in der Hierarchie aufzusteigen, eine Tatsache, die zu ebensoviel erschreckendem Eifer anspornt wie das religiöse Element, wenn nicht mehr.[PARAGRAPH:1]Weil sie zu jeder Zeit verteidigungsbereit sein müssen, gleichen abgelegene Dörfer kleinen Festungen, jeder Baurnhof ist eine kleine Burg und die Städte sind eigentlich Garnisonsstädte, obwohl sie auch Zentren des Handels, der Religion und der Diplomatie beherbergen. Nur wenige Männer haben keine Kampfnarben und die Frauen sind entschlossen und abgehärtet. Sie wissen, dass die Kinder, die sie großziehen, eines Tages in der Schlacht fallen könnten und sie wissen auch, dass der Krieg eines Tages ihre Heimat erreichen könnte. Deshalb ist selten eine Frau zu finden, die kein Schwert führen kann.[PARAGRAPH:1]Um die Struktur der bannorischen Gesellschaft vollständig verstehen zu können, muss man den Unterschied zwischen Lehen und "freiem Land" verstehen. Die Lehen sind riesige Landstriche, fast schon kleine Königreiche, unter der Herrschaft eines Ordens, einer Familie oder, einer der Eigenheiten der Bannor, eines Hausordens: ein religiöser Orden, dessen Mitglieder ausschließlich aus einem Klan stammen. Mit einer Festung oder einer kleinen befestigten Stadt als Mittelpunkt ist die Hauptaufgabe der Lehen, die notwendigen Mittel aufzubringen, um eine Ordens- oder Familien-Division aufstellen zu können. Diese starken und hochmotivierten Kampfverbände bilden das gefürchtete Rückgrat der bannorischen Armeen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Der Löwenanteil des Landes im Reich der Bannor ist "freies Land". Die Dörfer und Städte, die diese Gebiete in Anspruch nehmen und von ihnen leben, müssen, neben der Zahlung von Steuern und der Planung ihrer eigenen Verteidigung, entsprechend ihres Reichtums eine Anzahl voll ausgebildeter und ausgerüsteter Soldaten zur Verfügung stellen. Obwohl die Orden und die Familien die Speerspitze und die gepanzerte Faust der bannorischen Armeen bilden, besteht der Hauptteil der Soldaten, die für die Austragung einer Schlacht benötigt werden, aus Wehrpflichtigen aus dem "freien Land".[PARAGRAPH:1]Die bei weitem zahlreichsten Lehnsherren, die offenen Orden, nehmen Krieger aus der ganzen Welt auf, von allen Nationen und Rassen. Jene, die sich durch Tapferkeit und Intelligenz auszeichnen, werden in den Gebräuchen und der Sprache der Bannor unterwiesen und kämpfen in den Armeen gleichberechtigt mit gebürtigen Bannor.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Hausorden sind eigentlich Familienklans, die einen Orden gegründet oder übernommen haben. Alle Schlüsselpositionen werden von Familienmitgliedern besetzt und von Vater zu Sohn und Onkel zu Neffe vererbt, wie jeder normale Adelstitel. Dies ist eine der wenigen Möglichkeiten für eine reiche, nicht-adlige Familie, ein Lehen und die damit verbundene Macht und Verantwortung zu erhalten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die adligen Familien führen ihre Abstammung auf eine der Seelen zurück, die Sabathiel befreite. Sie benutzen dieses heilige Vermächtnis, um ihre enorme Machtfülle zu rechtfertigen und es ist der Grund, aus dem die Priesterschaft ihr Fortbestehen und ihre Einmischung in die Staatsgeschäfte dulden. Es gibt sehr wenige Adelsfamilien, aber jede von ihnen verfügt über ebensoviel Macht und Reichtum wie ein Orden. Die Priesterschaft wacht über diese weltlichen Machtzentren allerdings mit Sorgfalt und Strenge, damit sie nicht versuchen, die Struktur der bannorischen Gesellschaft zu verändern.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die gut ausgebildeten und ausgerüsteten Männer, die in den Divisionen der Orden und Familien Dienst tun, verfügen über vielfältige Herkünfte und kämpfen aus einer Vielzahl von Gründen: Einige tun es für Geld oder Ansehen, einige wenige kämpfen für die Ehre oder aus persönlichen Rachemotiven, aber die meisten ziehen in den Kampf, weil sie wirklich daran glauben, dass sie im Krieg gegen das Böse an vorderster Front stehen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Wie jeder bannorische Priester zu berichten weiß, ist der Krieg, in dem die Bannor kämpfen, deutlich komplizierter als ein simpler Konflikt zwischen Gut und Böse. Die Priesterschaft, unter der Führung von Sabathiel (wie sie selbst behaupten) entscheidet, wer ein Feind ist. Obwohl die Bannor bisher noch nie ihre Waffen gegen eine Zivilisation erhoben haben, die irgendeiner Art von Gesetz und einem Sinn für Gerechtigkeit und Mitgefühl folgt, wagt niemand, der es vermeiden kann, die Bannor zu verärgern, da man sonst "verdammt" und der Liste der Zivilisationen hinzugefügt würde, denen man Demut beibringen müsse.[PARAGRAPH:1]Der Brennpunkt des gesamten Reichs der Bannor ist ihre Haupstadt, die sich rund um den Palast der Bannor, die Hallen von Sabathiel, erhebt. Obwohl auch sie das Antlitz einer Garnisonsstadt trägt, präsentiert sie sich auch als eine ausufernde, internationale Metropole, mit der sich nur wenige andere Städte auf Erebus messen können. Hier haben die Orden ihre Hauptsitze, hier treffen sich die Familien, um Staatsangelegenheiten zu diskutieren, und hierher kommen die Menschen, um die Priesterschaft um Rat zu fragen. Menschen aller Völker strömen in die Stadt, um die Ränge der Orden anschwellen zu lasen, ein steter Strom von Besuchern füllt die Hallen von Sabathiel, die kommen, um Tribut zu zollen oder die Gunst eines Priesters zu erbitten, und die Basare und Märkte ziehen Händler von nah und fern an, die sich um die Bedürfnisse einer multi-ethnischen, multinationalen und multikulturellen Armee und Verwaltung kümmern.[PARAGRAPH:1]Da er nicht gewillt ist, einen Fuß auf Erebus zu setzen und die Vereinbarungen oder den Geist des Paktes zu brechen, heißt es, dass Sabathiel, der legendäre Herrscher der Bannor, tief in den Nischen seiner Hallen haust, beobachtend, lenkend, lehrend und über die Bannor wachend, während er sie weiter voran treibt, aber nicht in der Lage ist, sich körperlich zu manifestieren. Er ist ein Schattenkönig, immer als Schreckgespenst in ihren Gedanken präsent, aber seine Untertanen bekommen ihn nie zu Gesicht. Ihre Truppenkommandeure sind für die meisten Bannor sehr viel gegenwärtigere Gestalten, Capria ist dafür das beste Beispiel, da sie als junges Mädchen ihr Volk anführte, als dieses aus der Hölle hinaustrat, und früh während des Endes des Zeitalters des Eises und des Anbruchs des Zeitalters der Wiedergeburt an Ehre und Autorität gewann.[PARAGRAPH:1]Heutzutage gibt es viele, sogar unter den Bannor, aber vor allem unter ihren Feinden, die raunen, dass sowohl Sabathiel als auch die ursprünglichen Seelen nichts als Legenden seien, erfunden von einer aggressiven Priesterschaft, die nach Wegen suchte, um ihre Vorherrschaft zu legitimieren. Wie auch immer die Wahrheit aussehen mag, Tatsache ist, dass sich die Bannor im Zeitalter der Wiedergeburt müssen auf menschliches Fleisch und kalten Stahl verlassen müssen und nicht auf Engel und Seelen, um Recht und Gesetz bis in die dunkelsten Ecken der Welt zu tragen.</German>

[H1]Background[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1]The Bannor started with a handful of people, trapped in hell during the fall of Braduk but rescued by Sabathiel, an angel in Junil's service. In exchange for their salvation, the spirits bound themselves and their descendants to ceaselessly battle the forces of chaos and disorder. As Sabathiel led the honorable spirits forth into the light, they formed the vanguard in a devastating war against the Clan of Embers, even more powerful then than they are today. Throughout the entire Age of Rebirth the Bannor waged brutal and merciless war not only on the Clan, but on all who would not submit to law and order.[PARAGRAPH:1]Throughout this war of liberation and extermination, these heroes of an ancient age forged conquered, allied, and submitting tribes, cities, and nations into a human empire which, with the aid and guidance of Sabathiel, may stand firm even against the looming apocalypse, when unequaled evil is loosed upon Erebus. [PARAGRAPH:1]This continuing Holy War permeates every part of their society, leaving it almost totally militarized. For the Bannor, there is no clear line between religion, family, and politics. They apply a frightening religious fervor to the art of war, and their obsession with order makes even the peasant regiments among the best drilled of all the empires. All men are trained from childhood in the arts of war-hand-to-hand combat, archery, self defense, strength, and agility. Unlike most other societies, there are plenty of possibilities for rising through the ranks through bravery and skill, a fact which inspires as much if not more fighting fervor than the religious element.[PARAGRAPH:1]Because they need to be defended and ready at all times, outlying villages are more like forts, every farm is a small castle, the cities are huge garrison towns but also centers of trade, religion, and diplomacy. Few men are without scars from battle and the women are strong-willed and hardened. They know that the children they raise may one day be lost in battle, and they also know that one day the war may come to them. It is a rare woman among the Bannor that cannot handle a sword. [PARAGRAPH:1]A central part of understanding the fabric of Bannor society is understanding the split between estates and "free land." The estates are enormous tracts of land, almost sub-kingdoms, under the rule of an Order, a Family or one of those peculiarities of the Bannor: a Hereditary Order-a religious order with members exclusively from one clan. Centered on a stronghold or small fortified city, the main function of the estates is to provide the necessary resources to field one Order or Family division, the powerful and highly dedicated fighting forces that make up the feared backbone of the Bannor armies.[PARAGRAPH:1]The lion's share of the land in the Bannor empire is the "free land." The villages and cities that occupy and make a living off this land must, in addition to paying taxes and organizing their own defenses, provide a number of soldiers, fully trained and equipped, according to the wealth of the settlement. Although the Orders and Families are the spearhead and armored fist of Bannor armies, "free land" conscripts provide the bulk forces that are needed to carry a battle.[PARAGRAPH:1]By far the most numerous of the estate-holders, the non-hereditary Orders will take fighters from all across the world, all nations and races. Those deemed worthy in prowess and intelligence are taught in the ways and language of the Bannor and then join the fighting forces on the same footing as native Bannor.[PARAGRAPH:1]The hereditary Orders are in reality families that have founded or taken over control of an Order. All the major positions are held by and passed down from father to son, uncle to nephew, like any usual aristocratic title. It is one of the few options a rich non-noble family has of gaining an estate and the power and responsibility that comes with it.[PARAGRAPH:1]The noble Families all trace their lineage back to one of the spirits that Sabathiel set free. They use this holy heritage to legitimize their enormous power, and it is the reason the priesthood tolerates their existence and their meddling in the running of things. There are very few Families, but every one of them wields as much power and wealth as an Order. However, the priesthood keeps these secular powerhouses under careful and strict control, lest they attempt to change the fabric of Bannor society.[PARAGRAPH:1]The highly-trained and well-equipped men who fight in the professional divisions of the Orders and Families come from a variety of backgrounds and fight for any number of reasons: Some do it for money or status, some few do it for glory or personal revenge, but most do it because they truly believe they are on the front line of the war against Evil.[PARAGRAPH:1]As any Bannor priest could tell you, the war fought by the Bannor is far more complicated than a simple Good-Evil battle. The priesthood, under the guidance of Sabathiel (or so they claim) decide who is an enemy. Although they have yet to fight a civilization that conforms to some kind of law and sense of justice and compassion, few who can avoid it dare cross the Bannor, lest they be "damned" and added to the list of civilizations that must be taught to repent.[PARAGRAPH:1]The focal point of the entire Bannor Empire is their capital, centered around the Bannor Palace, The Halls of Sabathiel. Although still recognizably a garrison city, it is also a sprawling, international metropolis matched by few other cities in Erebus. This is where the Orders have their headquarters, this is where the Families meet to discuss affairs of state, and this is where people come to consult with the priesthood. People of all races flock to the city to swell the ranks of the Orders, the Halls of Sabathiel have a constant stream of visitors coming to pay tribute or ask favors of his priests, and the bazaars and markets attract traders from far and wide, catering to the needs of a multiracial, multinational and multicultural army and administration.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sabathiel, the mythical ruler of the Bannor, unwilling to set foot upon Erebus and break the letter or the spirit of the Compact, is said to reside deep within the recesses of his Halls, watching, guiding, teaching, and warding over the Bannor, urging them on but unable to physically manifest. He is a shadow king, never seen by his subjects but always a haunting figure, ever present in their consciousness. Their battlefield commanders are much more present figures to most Bannormen, Capria being the best example, who as a young girl led her people as they stepped from hell, and soon grew in honor and authority through the end of the Age of Ice and dawn of the Age of Rebirth.[PARAGRAPH:1]In this day, there are those even among the Bannor, and even more so among their enemies, who whisper that both Sabathiel and his original spirits are naught but legends invented by a militant priesthood looking for ways to legitimize their rule.

Everything in Calabim society exists to support their Vampire overlords. Morois are excellent for shock troopers. Bloodpets can scout, and in later game, can be consumed by Vampires to replenish their health. Even general population can be sacrificed for bolstering Vampires' xp.

After levelling up, Vampire units can be inaugurated into one of three Calabim Vampire Courts. White Court excels at dominating enemies. Red Court relies on raw strength. Black Court raises undead army to support their reign. Since Calabim starts with Death mana, which focuses on buffing undead, Black Court seems natural for Vampire units but either White or Red can open interesting options for Calabim player.

Calabim has good synergy with the Slaver's Guild. They can rush building using population and ignore part of the unhappiness penalty with Governor's Manor. For religion, Calabim player can choose most, gaining benefits from each of them.

[H1]Background[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1]The Age of Ice almost spelt the end of the vampires.

[PARAGRAPH:1]Led by the ancient siblings Alexis and Flauros, a small group of surviving vampires "adopted" a rag-tag tribe of humans. Using their powers as immortals, unaffected by cold, or exhaustion, gifted with incredible vision and speed, they made sure the tribe had plenty of food. And all they asked in return was an endless, expendable resource: A few drops of blood. But a vampire's powers are not restricted to supernatural senses and strength-their great power is in the mind.[PARAGRAPH:1]Slowly but surely, using their natural powers of guile and persuasion, and dangling the "Dark Gift" as bait to lure the best and strongest humans into helping them, the vampires wormed their way to the top of their little society.

[H1]Background[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1]Das Zeitalter des Eises bedeutete für die Vampire fast das Ende. Als sich das Eis über das einst fruchtbare Land ausbreitete, begann ihre Hauptnahrungsquelle, die Menschheit, immer knapper zu werden und sich zu immer kleineren Stämmen zusammenzufinden. Da sie ein schlimmeres Schicksal als den Tod fürchteten, nämlich den schattenhaften Beinahe-Tod eines Vampires, der frischer Nahrung für Jahrhunderte beraubt wird, versuchten die meisten Vampire, sich an die immer kleiner werdenden Gemeinschaften der Überlebenden zu klammern. Aber ein einzelner Vampir, der von einer kleinen Gruppe von Menschen gefangen wurde, wurde schnell vom Jäger zum Gejagten. Einer nach dem anderen wurde so ins Jenseits befördert.[PARAGRAPH:1]Von den wenigen Vampiren, die den Jägern entwischen konnten, fristeten die meisten ein Dasein als Wilde, ernährten sich von dem minderwertigen Blut, das sie in der Wildnis ergattern konnten, und machten gelegentlich Jagd auf einen Menschen, der zu seinem Unglück allein unterwegs war. Aber einige wenige weise Vampire begriffen, dass der einzige Weg zu überleben darin lag, die natürliche Wandlung vom Parasiten zum Herren und Meister zu vollziehen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Eine kleine Gruppe von überlebenden Vampiren, die von den Geschwistern Alexis und Flauros geführt wurde, "adoptierten" einen bunt gemischten Stamm von Menschen. Indem sie ihre Fähigkeiten als Unsterbliche benutzten, gefeit gegen Kälte oder Ermüdung und ausgestattet mit unglaublicher Weitsicht und Geschwindigkeit, stellten sie sicher, dass der Stamm über reichlich Nahrung verfügte. Und als einzige Gegenleistung verlangten sie einen im Überfluss zur Verfügung stehenden und verzichtbaren Rohstoff: ein paar Tropfen Blut. Aber die Kräfte eines Vampirs sind nicht nur auf übernatürliche Sinne und Stärke beschränkt, ihre eigentliche Stärke ist ihr Geist.[PARAGRAPH:1]Indem sie ihre angeborenen Fähigkeiten der List und der Überredung einsetzten und die besten und stärksten Menschen mit der "Dunklen Gabe" als Belohnung für deren Hilfe köderten, stiegen die Vampire langsam aber sicher zu den Anführern ihrer kleinen Gesellschaft auf. Einzelne wollten sich ihnen widersetzen und riskierten, ihre wertvollen Fähigkeiten als Jäger zu verlieren. Jene, die es tatsächlich versuchten, erlitten Unfälle oder verschwanden ganz einfach.[PARAGRAPH:1]Als die Menschen schließlich begriffen, was vor sich ging, war es schon zu spät. Sie waren in einer höllischen Lage gefangen, kaum mehr als Vieh für eine wachsende Schicht von parasitären Adligen, und ihr eigener freier Wille hatte sie in diese Situation gebracht.[PARAGRAPH:1]Inzwischen sind Flauros und Alexis der Großprinz und die Großprinzessin einer verkommenen und hoffnungslosen Gesellschaft von Blutdienern und Sklaven geworden, die von den Großen Bruten kontrolliert wird, den Vampirfamilien, die jede Stadt wie ihre eigenen Gutshöfe beherrschen, in dekadentem Luxus schwelgen und ihren Blutdurst nach Belieben stillen. Die Calabim sind der Gipfel der vampirischen Evolution, eine Abscheulichkeit, die der natürliche Feind einer jeden heiligen Nation ist.</German>

        <English>[PARAGRAPH:1]
Clan of Embers is a congregation of various Goblin, Orc, Lizardmen and Ogre tribes. Their main strength is their brute power. Clan's early units are considerably stronger than other civs. Early game, the Clan's raw military power is unrivaled.

With Warrens, Clan player gain two units for the cost of one. This highlights Clan's early game power. Rush and destroy is a valid strategy for Clan of Embers.

The Clan's weakness lies in mid and late game. Clan can not build advanced scientific buildings. On top of that, their Barbarian trait reduces any culture, arcane and science output by -20%, making them the worst researcher, even worse than the Doviello. Thus, while it is possible for Clan player to research high end units, it is very rare for Clan of Ember to do so.

[H1]Background[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1]Fire was the tool Kylorin used to cleanse the rot from Patria, for Bhall had given her righteous followers gifts to rival those sorcerous powers gained first from Ceridwen. The passionate fire goddess was a force for good. Those who loved justice and mercy could use her power to counter the wicked mages Kylorin had trained. But she fell to the wily whispers of Agares, God of Despair, raining fire on the just and unjust alike in a terrible day heralding the end of the Age of Magic. Once devout men of many nations, the orcs were transformed, cursed and enraged when Bhall fell. The holy city of Braduk had the goddess pass through as she fell from the Heavens, taking many of those who loved goodness and trapping them in Hell. Half the city was rendered a flaming pit, but those people who remained, in touch with the fiery spirit of Bhall, were twisted into the orcs. Mulcarn, Bhall's former nemesis, took this chance to claim dominion over Erebus, and the orcs, along with the rest of the world, were ushered into the Age of Ice. [PARAGRAPH:1]They survived, huddled around the fires of Braduk the Burning, and developed barbarous rituals and a savage warrior culture, raiding struggling human settlements. The holy scepter of the High Priest of Bhall was affixed with a brutal axe head by the Orc warlord Orthus, and many nascent tribes fell to its power. One people stood up to the orcs, though. Those who had been taken to Hell with Bhall were freed by Sabathiel, the Archangel of Junil late in the Age of Ice, as Mulcarn's contest with Kylorin drew near. These battle-hardened warriors were a true test for the savage orcs, but the orcs were too numerous for the Bannor to defeat, living in the relative luxury amidst the fires of Braduk. Jonas was a fierce warlord of great renown among the orcs, who resented being subordinate to the matriarchal priesthood of Bhall. He staged a coup against the high priestess, but Bhall took notice of her people again, and humbled Jonas, making him her priest. Captured as a babe, the orc Sheelba was raised among the Bannor as a human girl but was spurned and taken in by the orc clans, united under Jonas's Ember Banner. Her insights into civilization have the potential to allow these clans to rise above the petty barbarous orc tribes led by the likes of Orthus, even as their sheer strength and Jonas's cunning allows them to tear down the human civilizations.</English>

[H1]Background[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1]Feuer war das Werkzeug, das Kylorin einsetzte, um Patria von der Fäulnis zu säubern, denn Bhall hatte ihren rechtschaffenen Anhängern ebenfalls Gaben verliehen, um es mit den Zauberkräften, die zuvor durch Ceridwen erlangt wurden, aufnehmen zu können. Die leidenschaftliche Feuergöttin war eine Macht des Guten. Jene, die der Gerechtigkeit und der Barmherzigkeit verschrieben waren, konnten ihre Kräfte nutzen, um den boshaften Magier, die Kylorin ausgebildet hatte, entgegentreten zu können. Aber sie verfiel den verschlagenen Einflüsterungen von Agares, dem Gott der Verzweiflung, ließ an einem furchtbaren Tag, der das Ende des Zeitalters der Magie einläutete, Feuer auf die Gerechten und die Ungerechten gleichermaßen niederregnen. Die Orks, die sich einst aus frommen Menschen vieler Reiche zusammensetzten, wurden verwandelt, verflucht und erzürnt, als Bhall fiel. Die Göttin durchschlug die heilige Stadt Braduk, als sie vom Himmel stürzte und nahm viele, die das Gute liebten, mit sich in die Hölle. Die Hälfte der Stadt bestand nur noch aus einer brennenden Grube, während das Erscheinungsbild der Überlebenden, die noch mit der feurigen Essenz von Bhall verbunden waren, zu jenem der Orks verdreht wurde. Mulcarn, Bhalls einstiger Erzfeind, ergriff diese Gelegenheit, um die Vorherrschaft über Erebus zu beanspruchen, so dass die Orks, zusammen mit dem Rest der Welt, in das Zeitalter des Eises gezwungen wurden.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sie überlebten, dicht gedrängt um die Feuer von Braduk der Brennenden, und entwickelten barbarische Rituale und eine wilde Kriegerkultur, während sie ums Überleben kämpfende menschliche Siedlungen überfielen. Das heilige Zepter des Hohepriesters von Bhall wurde vom orkischen Kriegsherren Orthus an einem groben Axtkopf befestigt und viele im Entstehen begriffene Stämme fielen seiner Macht zum Opfer. Ein Volk bot den Orks jedoch die Stirn. Jene, die mit Bhall zur Hölle gefahren waren, wurden von Sabathiel, dem Erzengel von Junil, spät im Zeitalter des Eises befreit, als Mulcarns Kampf mit Kylorin immer näher rückte. Diese kampferfahrenen Krieger waren ein echte Herausforderung für die wilden Orks, aber die Orks waren zu zahlreich, als dass die Bannor sie besiegen konnten, da sie in der verhältnismäßigen Behaglichkeit der Feuern von Braduk gelebt hatten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Jonas war ein grimmiger Kriegsherr von großem Ansehen unter den Orks, dem es nicht gefiel, dass er sich der matriarchalischen Priesterschaft von Bhall unterordnen musste. So inszenierte er einen Staatsstreich gegen die Hohepriesterin, aber Bhall wurde wieder auf ihr Volk aufmerksam und demütigte Jonas, indem sie ihn zu ihrem Priester machte.[PARAGRAPH:1]Als Kleinkind entführt, wurde die Orkin Sheelba zunächst von den Bannor als Menschenmädchen aufgezogen, aber schon bald verstoßen und von den orkischen Klans aufgenommen, die unter Jonas' Aschenbanner vereint worden waren. Ihre Einblicke in die Zivilisation haben das Potential, diesen Klans zu ermöglichen, über die kleinen barbarischen Ork-Klans hinauszuwachsen, die von Orthus und seinesgleichen angeführt werden. Gerade weil ihre bloße Stärke und Jonas' Durchtriebenheit ihnen sowieso ermöglicht, die menschlichen Zivilisationen niederzureißen.</German>

Clan of Embers is a congregation of various Goblin, Orc, Lizardmen and Ogre tribes. Their main strength is their brute power. Clan's early units are considerably stronger than other civs. Early game, the Clan's raw military power is unrivaled.

With Warrens, Clan player gain two units for the cost of one. This highlights Clan's early game power. Rush and destroy is a valid strategy for Clan of Embers.

The Clan's weakness lies in mid and late game. Clan can not build advanced scientific buildings. On top of that, their Barbarian trait reduces any culture, arcane and science output by -20%, making them the worst researcher, even worse than the Doviello. Thus, while it is possible for Clan player to research high end units, it is very rare for Clan of Ember to do so.

[H1]Background[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1]Fire was the tool Kylorin used to cleanse the rot from Patria, for Bhall had given her righteous followers gifts to rival those sorcerous powers gained first from Ceridwen. The passionate fire goddess was a force for good. Those who loved justice and mercy could use her power to counter the wicked mages Kylorin had trained. But she fell to the wily whispers of Agares, God of Despair, raining fire on the just and unjust alike in a terrible day heralding the end of the Age of Magic. Once devout men of many nations, the orcs were transformed, cursed and enraged when Bhall fell. The holy city of Braduk had the goddess pass through as she fell from the Heavens, taking many of those who loved goodness and trapping them in Hell. Half the city was rendered a flaming pit, but those people who remained, in touch with the fiery spirit of Bhall, were twisted into the orcs. Mulcarn, Bhall's former nemesis, took this chance to claim dominion over Erebus, and the orcs, along with the rest of the world, were ushered into the Age of Ice. [PARAGRAPH:1]They survived, huddled around the fires of Braduk the Burning, and developed barbarous rituals and a savage warrior culture, raiding struggling human settlements. The holy scepter of the High Priest of Bhall was affixed with a brutal axe head by the Orc warlord Orthus, and many nascent tribes fell to its power. One people stood up to the orcs, though. Those who had been taken to Hell with Bhall were freed by Sabathiel, the Archangel of Junil late in the Age of Ice, as Mulcarn's contest with Kylorin drew near. These battle-hardened warriors were a true test for the savage orcs, but the orcs were too numerous for the Bannor to defeat, living in the relative luxury amidst the fires of Braduk. Jonas was a fierce warlord of great renown among the orcs, who resented being subordinate to the matriarchal priesthood of Bhall. He staged a coup against the high priestess, but Bhall took notice of her people again, and humbled Jonas, making him her priest. Captured as a babe, the orc Sheelba was raised among the Bannor as a human girl but was spurned and taken in by the orc clans, united under Jonas's Ember Banner.

Doviello is very focused on melee units. Their melee units have the chance to be upgraded to higher tier units after combat. This could lead to early advantage for Doviello, which is important to get since Doviello is weak in later stage of the game.

Being unable to build Sage District and other advanced scientific buildings, Doviello is very limited in scientific advancements. Doviello will have to make up this disadvantage by using brute force, defeating enemies before they can complete more advanced research and build better troops.

Another long term weakness of the Doviello is that most of their units can not wear sophisticated gears. This will make Doviello at disadvantage when facing advanced empires with great supply of weapons and armours.

[H1]Background[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1]Charadon war ein junger Mann, der während des rauen Zeitalters des Eises aufgewachsen war. Ob dies für seine Wildheit verantwortlich war oder ein anderer Makel der Welt, ist eine Frage für die Gelehrten, aber sie ermöglichte ihm und seinem Stamm zu überleben. Er kopierte die Taktiken der Wolfsrudel, die Jagd auf seine Leute machten, indem er die Stärksten unter seine Fittiche nahm und die Nahrung mit jenen teilte, die dem Stamm halfen zu überleben, während diejenigen zurückgelassen wurden, die ihn aufhielten. Andere Männer und Frauen schlossen sich dem Stamm an, die nur zwischen der Unterwerfung unter Mulcarns Priesterschaft der Weißen Hand und einem einsamen kalten Tod wählen konnten. Nur die Doviello waren frei und gediehen im Herzen des Winters, allerdings war der Preis dafür jeder edle Zug ihrer Menschlichkeit. Die herrschenden Illianer ließen die Doviello in Ruhe, damit sie auf jene Stämme Jagd machen konnten, die sich Mulcarns Feindschaft verdient hatten. Schließlich trafen die Doviello und Kylorins Amuriten aufeinander und der wilde Wolf war gezwungen zu fliehen. Kylorin war ihnen so überlegen, dass sie sich gegen ihren früheren Meister wandten. Nun, da das Zeitalter der Wiedergeburt anbricht, fragen sich die Doviello, ob sie nicht einen Fehler begangen haben. Sie haben das getan, wovon sie dachten, dass es nötig gewesen sei, um zu überleben, aber, indem sie zugelassen haben, dass das Zeitalters des Eises endet, sehen sie nun ihre eigene Lebensweise gefährdet. Der Wolf ist anpassungsfähig, aber ebenso durchtrieben, und sollten sie Wind von den Plänen Auric Ulvins bekommen, könnte sich für sie eine Möglichkeit eröffnen, ihre alte Stärke wiederherzustellen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Mahala strebt danach, den Geist ihres Gründers, Charadon, wieder zu erwecken, dessen Herrschaft die Verbindung zu den wilden Wurzeln der Doviello erneuern würde, auch wenn dem derzeitigen Rudelführer der Doviello ebenfalls ein Pfad der Stärke durch Zivilisierung offen steht.</German>

[H1]Background[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1]In the Age of Dragons the gods waged war through proxies, fierce Dragons, wild Krakens, and armies of lesser angels and demons and, rarely, face to face. In either case, the destruction caused was cataclysmic.[PARAGRAPH:1]Immanuel Logos was a follower of Sirona, Goddess of Wisdom. He ruled a small tribe in her name, dispensing wisdom and providing shelter for her followers. Until one day he observed her army, a phalanx of titans, marching upon a stronghold of Aeron. The armies met in a field worked by a group of subsistence farmers. When the battle ended, the armies were tattered, but the bystanders were worse, broken in body, fields destroyed, and despondent of spirit. It was a scene played out countless times, as dragons crushed struggling settlements when they clashed or holy fire rained down upon those caught in the middle. Immanuel believed in his goddess, but he could no longer stand on the sidelines, nor confine his care to his own people.[PARAGRAPH:1]Off came his regal symbols, and he tossed aside his sacred spear for the last time. He gathered orphaned children in his arms, and doled comfort to the dying. Sirona watched this noble leader leave her service but did not forbid him leaving. She knew that for humanity to survive, they needed more than someone fighting on their behalf. They needed care and shelter through the days of heavenly warfare.[PARAGRAPH:1]Thus was born an order of monks. Before the compact, they had no permanent home. They traveled the world, tending to the battered and broken under the guidance of Immanuel and his successors, who took his name to show their spiritual heritage and authority. Their service attracted other kind-hearted souls to their numbers, and they became one of the most trusted groups in the eyes of men and angels. Thus, when the compact was forged, they were the only mortals who witnessed the handing of the Godslayer to the legend Finner. The agreement of the gods to withdraw from direct combat in mortal realms was met by the world Erebus herself with great joy, and at that spot seven fir trees were born to stand witness. Before departing, Sucellus tasked the order of the Elohim with tending to this and other sacred sites, some symbols of great importance, some fonts of power.[PARAGRAPH:1]As the kingdoms of men arose in the Age of Magic, the Elohim continued this mission, peacefully when possible, with force when necessary. Warlords who searched for clues to the location of Finner's tomb, wizards who coveted an angel's tears for his magics, and others sought the Elohim's knowledge, secrets that they often died to protect. The warrior monk tradition was begun in these trying times, men who carried no weapon, so anathema was warfare to them, but could subdue marauders within the blink of an eye. The monk's purity was a ward against the more vile forces that sought to harm their charges.[PARAGRAPH:1]Then came Bhall's fall and Mulcarn's breach of the Compact. The Elohim lost contact with many of their sacred sites, abandoning them to the elements and wild men. But they returned to their original mission, and traveled to desperate communities, tending to disease and enshrining dying knowledge in chants and stories so when rebirth came, it would be swift and complete. As in the Age of Dragons, their numbers swelled with those inspired by their example, and they became not just an order, but a nation.[PARAGRAPH:1]Today that nation has emerged into the sunlight of rebirth. Einion Logos is the head of the ancient order of Elohim, a position of unequaled respect. He is ancient himself, but wishes to live however long enough to see his followers reclaim their shrines. Gariel the Strong was the King of the Elohim nation which shelters the order. He led his people out of the Age of Ice, but his reign was cut short by illness and passed to Ethne the White, his daughter who must now withstand the trials of the Age of Rebirth.</English>

[H1]Background[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1]Immanuel Logos war ein Anhänger von Sirona, der Göttin der Weisheit. Er regierte einen kleinen Stamm in ihrem Namen, verbreitete sein Wissen und bot ihren Anhängern Schutz. Bis er eines Tages sah, wie ihre Armee, eine Phalanx von Titanen, auf eine Festung von Aeron vorrückte. Die Armeen trafen sich auf einem Feld, das von einigen Bauern bestellt wurde. Als der Lärm der Schlacht sich legte, waren die stolzen Armeen dezimiert und versprengt, aber die unfreiwilligen Zuschauer hatte es noch härter getroffen: jeder Knochen im Körper gebrochen, ihre Felder zerstört und Mutlosigkeit machte sich in ihren Seelen breit. Diese Szene wiederholte sich unzählige Male, so zerschmetterten aufeinander prallende Drachen ums Überleben kämpfende Siedlungen oder heiliges Feuer ergoss sich über jene, die zwischen den Fronten gefangen waren. Immanuel glaubte an seine Göttin, aber er konnte nicht länger abseits stehen und seine Fürsorge nur seinen eigenen Leuten zukommen lassen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Er legte seine königlichen Symbole ab und warf seinen heiligen Speer ein letztes Mal beiseite. Er schloss Waisenkinder in seine Arme und leistete den Sterbenden Beistand. Sirona sah, dass dieser edle Anführer ihre Dienste verließ, jedoch hielt sie ihn nicht zurück. Sie wusste, damit die Menschheit überleben konnte, war mehr nötig als jemand, der in ihrem Namen kämpfte. Die Menschen brauchten Schutz und Fürsorge während der Zeit des himmlischen Krieges.[PARAGRAPH:1]So wurde ein Orden von Mönchen geboren. Vor dem Pakt hatten sie keine feste Heimstatt. Sie zogen durch die Welt und sorgten für die Geschundenen und Gebrochenen unter der Führung von Immanuel und seinen Nachfolgern, die seinen Namen als Zeichen ihrer spirituellen Herkunft und Autorität annahmen. Ihre Aufopferung zog weitere mildtätige Seelen an und sie wurden in den Augen von Menschen und Engeln zu einer der vertrauenswürdigsten Gruppen. So kam es, dass sie, als der Pakt geschmiedet wurde, die einzigen Sterblichen waren, die die Übergabe des Gottesschlächters an den legendären Finner beiwohnten. Die Übereinkunft der Götter, sich aus dem direkten Kampf in der Welt der Sterblichen zurückzuziehen, wurde von der Welt Erebus mit großer Freude aufgenommen und an jener Stelle wurden sieben Tannen als Zeugen des Augenblicks gepflanzt. Bevor er diese Welt verließ, beauftrage Sucellus den Orden der Elohim damit, für diese und andere heilige Stätten zu sorgen, einige davon Symbole von großer Bedeutung, andere Zeichen großer Macht.[PARAGRAPH:1]Als die Königreiche der Menschen im Zeitalter der Magie erblühten, setzten die Elohim diese Mission fort, friedlich, wenn möglich, mit Gewalt, falls nötig. Kriegsherren, die nach Hinweisen auf den Ort von Finners Grab suchten, Zauberer, die eine Engelsträne für ihre Magie begehrten, und andere versuchten, das Wissen der Elohim in ihre Gewalt zu bringen, Geheimnisse, für deren Schutz diese oft ihr Leben ließen. Die Tradition der Krieger-Mönche wurde in jenen schweren Zeiten begründet, Männer, die keine Waffen trugen, da ihnen der Krieg ein Gräuel war, die jedoch jeden Straßenräuber innerhalb eines Augenblicks bezwingen konnten. Die Reinheit der Mönche bildete einen Schutz gegen die bösartigen Kräfte, die ihrer Mission schaden wollten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Dann ereignete sich Bhalls Sturz und Mulcarns Bruch des Paktes. Die Elohim verloren den Kontakt zu vielen ihrer heiligen Stätten und überließen sie den Elementen und den Wilden. Aber sie kehrten zu ihrer ursprünglichen Mission zurück, besuchten verzweifelte Gemeinden, behandelten Krankheiten und bewahrten aussterbendes Wissen in Liedern und Geschichten, so dass es bei der Wiedergeburt der Welt schnell und vollständig wiederhergestellt werden könnte. Wie im Zeitalter der Drachen füllten sich ihre Ränge mit jenen, die von ihrem Vorbild inspiriert wurden, und aus dem Orden der Elohim erwuchs eine eigene Nation.[PARAGRAPH:1]Heute ist diese Nation in das Licht der Wiedergeburt getretten. Einon Logos ist das Oberhaupt des altehrwürdigen Ordens der Elohim, eine Stellung, die beispiellosen Respekt gebietet. Er ist selbst ein alter Mann, aber sein Wunsch ist es, lange genug zu leben, um zu sehen, wie seine Anhänger ihre heiligen Stätten zurückgewinnen. Gariel der Starke war der König des Volkes der Elohim, das den Orden schützt. Er führte sein Volk aus dem Zeitalter des Eises hinaus, aber Krankheit setzte seiner Herrschaft ein jähes Ende. Die Krone ging an Ethne die Weiße, seine Tochter, die nun die Prüfungen des Zeitalters der Wiedergeburt meistern muss.</German>

The Elohim lost contact with many of their sacred sites, abandoning them to the elements and wild men. But they returned to their original mission, and traveled to desperate communities, tending to disease and enshrining dying knowledge in chants and stories so when rebirth came, it would be swift and complete. As in the Age of Dragons, their numbers swelled with those inspired by their example, and they became not just an order, but a nation.[PARAGRAPH:1]Today that nation has emerged into the sunlight of rebirth. Einion Logos is the head of the ancient order of Elohim, a position of unequaled respect. He is ancient himself, but wishes to live however long enough to see his followers reclaim their shrines.

        <Spanish>[PARAGRAPH:1]
Three out of seven Elohim units are Disciple, making Elohim is perfect for pursuing Altar victory. This is further enhanced by Elohim's series of unique buildings which provide extra priest slots and Prophet GPP. Elohim player might be interested in building their economy around priests and farming Great Prophet.

One of their units, Dovoveo, has +2 Life affinity thus opening a new strategy for mana-rich Elohim. They can rely on Dovoveo army to attack enemies and then cast Pacify to prevent retaliation during enemy's turn. Mana-rich Elohim also benefits from going deep in magic by unlocking their other unit, Shrine Maiden, down in Life magic school tree.

Elohim's biggest weakness might be in middle game, before they unlock Tier 4 units. During this period, other civs can strengthen their units using gear but Elohim can not because their Monks refuse to wear any. But of course, the Monks' humbleness open other ways to use the abundant yields like for potions or buildings.

Grigori's main strength is their Adventurers. After battle, Adventurer has a chance to gain Hero promotion. This is strong in itself, yet for Adventurer, there is more. Each Adventurer has unique racial or origin promotion. After gaining Hero promotion, Adventurer can be upgraded to high tier unit according to their race or origin, without tech or yield requirements. This upgrade does cost hefty amount of gold, though, so be prepared!

While Adventurers are available for every civ lucky enough to attain them, Grigori starts with one Adventurer and will gain another one upon completing their Rising Legend project. Furthermore, Grigori Militias have the chance to be Adventurers after combat, making it is possible for Grigori to amass stacks of Adventurers and upgrade them to various high tier units.

Grigori are agnostics, thus unable to adopt religion. They are quite advanced in non-religious social organisation though, reflected in their extra Guild from their starting tech. Grigori also get more imperial culture from Great Bard's Tale, which player can spend to unlock Guild techs or to buy new traits. Spending some imperial culture on Healer's Circle will provide Grigori with healing potions and skills, which usually are being covered by priests and high priests.

[H1]Background[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1]Cassiel war ein Engel im Dienste von Dagda. Während des Zeitalters der Drachen beschützte er die Menschen, die sich vor der Macht der kriegführenden Göttern versteckten. Auf seinen Rat hin entwarf und unterschrieb Dagda den Pakt, jedoch war Cassiel der Meinung, dass der Pakt nicht weit genug ging. Er wollte, dass sich die Götter gänzlich zurückzogen, damit sich die Menschen ihre eigene Welt aufbauen könnten. Als den Göttern durch den Pakt erlaubt wurde, ihre Kriege mit Hilfe der Menschen zu führen, verließ Cassiel Dagdas Dienste und begann seinen eigenen Kreuzzug, um die Menschen aus einem Krieg herauszuführen, mit dem sie kaum etwas zu tun hatten. Durch diese Tat gewann er nur wenige Verbündete unter den Göttern oder den Menschen, die ihnen dienten. Einige wenige tapfere Seelen teilten Cassiels Überzeugungen, obwohl er sich weigerte, göttliche Wohltaten anzubieten oder sogar direkte Führungsaufgaben wahrzunehmen. Seine Anhänger müssen sich seinen Idealen verpflichten und sich selbst regieren. Während aller Zeitalter boten die Städte der Grigori sichere Zuflucht für jene, die ihr Leben selbst bestimmen wollten. Die Kriege des Zeitalters der Magie und der Mangel des Zeitalters des Eises verlangten von ihnen denselben Tribut wie von anderen Völkern, aber sie vertrauten nicht auf die Hilfe des Himmels, sondern aufeinander.[PARAGRAPH:1]Im Zeitalter der Wiedergeburt steht Cassiel immer noch bereit, um seine Ideale und seien Rat anzubieten, aber wenig mehr, und einige wenige Tapfere werden immer noch von seinen Idealen angezogen. Unter denen, die in seinen Landen um Asyl bitten, befinden sich die Luonnotar, die lehren, dass keiner der auf Erebus aktiven Götter der Anbetung würdig ist, sondern nur der eine höchste Gott, der sie erschaffen hat. Cassiel stimmt dem ersten Teil dieser Aussage sicherlich zu, auch wenn er den zweiten Teil nicht gutheißen kann.</German>

Hippus is all about mounted unit, even more so than Kuriotates. The majority of Hippus units start with mount, giving them extra movement. Beelining for mounted techs and finally building Ride of the Nine Kings will be beneficial for Hippus player.

Special for Hippus, their arcane units also start with movement of 2, making them the fastest adepts in Erebus. They can keep up with Hippus fast movement to some extent and it is possible to use them for hit-and-run tactics.

The main weakness of Hippus is their mounted units do not receive defensive bonus. Therefore, Hippus units are vulnerable toward enemy retaliation attacks after their first charge.

[H1]Background[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1]The Hippus were always justly proud of their animal husbandry. Their lands, even in the Age of Magic, had fertile hills that teemed with sheep and wide plains with vast herds of horses that they tamed very shortly after the Compact, passing this trade down in their tribes since time immemorial. However in Patria magic surpassed the use of horses for most purposes. Great creatures were conjured for war, portals allowed rapid travel, and golems toiled endlessly in the fields. Then came the great upheaval of Patria, when magicians turned against each other, battling for the soul of the empire of man. Kylorin called upon the Hippus people to help him hunt down his wayward servants as the portals across Erebus were closed, and when Demons and Elementals were banished the wild Hippus raiders were still there to charge down enemy warrior mages. These exploits brought great renown to a people formerly ignored in the great empire, even as the empire crumbled. This new-found pride crippled the Hippus, breeding a fierce martial competitiveness. Their clans, even while nominally aligned, would refuse each other's help and even raid each other. They were able to hold back the advances of the frostling hordes of the Age of Ice, though many Hippus communities were wiped out by a frost golem assault rather than seek the aid of their cohorts. [PARAGRAPH:1] As the other great nations emerged into the Age of Rebirth, the Hippus turned to raid them, as well as each other, until this proud people looked to be eclipsed by peoples more united and disciplined. Rhoanna, who inherited leadership of a small Hippus tribe, made it her mission to unite her people without losing their culture. She formed the Hippus mercenary companies, and made their martial prowess and competitiveness serve them rather then consume them.

[H1]Background[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1]Die Hippus waren immer mit Recht stolz auf ihre Viehhaltung. Ihre Ländereien bestanden, selbst im Zeitalter der Magie, aus fruchtbaren Hügeln, die vor Schafen wimmelten, und weiten Ebenen mit gewaltigen Pferdeherden, die sie kurz nach Unterzeichnung des Paktes zähmten und dann dieses Handwerk in ihren Stämmen seit alters her weitergaben. Allerdings machte die Magie den Einsatz von Pferden für die meisten Zwecke in Patria überflüssig. Große Kreaturen wurden für Kriege beschworen, Portale erlaubten schnelles Reisen und Golems schufteten pausenlos auf den Feldern. Dann geschah der große Aufstand von Patria, als sich Zauberer gegeneinander wandten und um die Seele des Menschenimperiums kämpften. Kylorin rief das Volk der Hippus um Hilfe an, um seine unberechenbaren Diener zu jagen, als die Portale überall auf Erebus verschlossen wurden. Und als Dämonen und Elementare gebannt waren, waren die wilden Räuber der Hippus immer noch dabei, feindliche Kampfmagier niederzureiten. Diese Heldentaten brachten einem Volk großes Ansehen, das zuvor im großen Imperium immer übergangen worden war, selbst als dieses Imperium zerfiel. Dieser neu entdeckte Stolz lähmte die Hippus und gebar ein grimmiges, kriegerisches Konkurrenzdenken. Ihre Klans begannen, sich gegenseitige Hilfe zu verweigern und sich sogar gegenseitig zu überfallen, selbst wenn sie eigentlich verbündet waren.

Rhoanna, die die Führung eines kleinen hippusischen Stammes inne hatte, machte es sich zur Aufgabe, ihr Volk zu einen, ohne ihre Kultur aufgeben zu müssen. Sie stellte die hippusischen Söldnerkompanien auf und schaffte es, ihre kriegerischen Fähigkeiten und ihr Konkurrenzdenken in Stärken umzuwandeln, die sie nicht mehr aufzehrten. Tasunke war der berühmteste Räuber der Hippus: es war erwartet worden, dass er sie zu einem Kampf um die Herrschaft herausfordern würde, aber er schloss sich breitwillig ihrem Argument an, dass ausländisches Gold ein besseres Maß für die Fähigkeiten eines Stammes seien, als getötete Blutsbrüder.</German>

Hippus is all about mounted unit, even more so than Kuriotates. The majority of Hippus units start with mount, giving them extra movement. Beelining for mounted techs and finally building Ride of the Nine Kings will be beneficial for Hippus player.

Special for Hippus, their arcane units also start with movement of 2, making them the fastest adepts in Erebus. They can keep up with Hippus fast movement to some extent and it is possible to use them for hit-and-run tactics.

The main weakness of Hippus is their mounted units do not receive defensive bonus. Therefore, Hippus units are vulnerable toward enemy retaliation attacks after their first charge. Also, while Hippus gains benefit from religion, employing disciple units will slow their army unless Hippus player pays gold to buy mounts for the disciple units.

[H1]Background[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1]The Hippus were always justly proud of their animal husbandry. Their lands, even in the Age of Magic, had fertile hills that teemed with sheep and wide plains with vast herds of horses that they tamed very shortly after the Compact, passing this trade down in their tribes since time immemorial. However in Patria magic surpassed the use of horses for most purposes. Great creatures were conjured for war, portals allowed rapid travel, and golems toiled endlessly in the fields. Then came the great upheaval of Patria, when magicians turned against each other, battling for the soul of the empire of man. Kylorin called upon the Hippus people to help him hunt down his wayward servants as the portals across Erebus were closed, and when Demons and Elementals were banished the wild Hippus raiders were still there to charge down enemy warrior mages. These exploits brought great renown to a people formerly ignored in the great empire, even as the empire crumbled. This new-found pride crippled the Hippus, breeding a fierce martial competitiveness. Their clans, even while nominally aligned, would refuse each other's help and even raid each other. They were able to hold back the advances of the frostling hordes of the Age of Ice, though many Hippus communities were wiped out by a frost golem assault rather than seek the aid of their cohorts. [PARAGRAPH:1] As the other great nations emerged into the Age of Rebirth, the Hippus turned to raid them, as well as each other, until this proud people looked to be eclipsed by peoples more united and disciplined. Rhoanna, who inherited leadership of a small Hippus tribe, made it her mission to unite her people without losing their culture. She formed the Hippus mercenary companies, and made their martial prowess and competitiveness serve them rather then consume them. Tasunke was the most famous raider amongst the Hippus; it was expected that he would challenge her for leadership, but he embraced her idea, seeing foreign gold as a better measure of a tribe's prowess than slain kinsmen. </Spanish>

Obwohl jähzornig und ungeduldig, ist er doch auch durchtrieben und dazu bereit, die Königreiche der Menschen zu beobachten, auch um von ihnen zu lernen, wie man in dieser Welt agiert, jedenfalls bis seine Ziele erfüllt sind und er so viele Sterbliche wie möglich in die Hölle schaffen kann, um sie bis in alle Ewigkeit zu peinigen.</German>

Khazad loves gold. This is reflected in Dwarven Vault mechanic, automatically built in Khazad cities. The vaults evaluate the amount of gold empire wid and divide that with the number of cities. If the amount of gold per city is above certain threshold, the vaults will give benefits to the cities. If the amount is low, the citizen will be unhappy.

Khazad has great synergy with Artisan's Guild since mine grants access to silver, gold, gems and ambers, which then transformed into money using buildings further down in the guild line. Since most of Khazad units require metal yield, they find the best synergy with Runes of Kilmorph, mainly for ROK's affinity with metals and mined resources, giving them even more money and metals.

One drawback of Khazad is their lack of magical aptitude. Khazad can build only adepts. They also start with Nature magic which has zero direct damage spells. Since it might be better to just use dwarven army instead of summons, Khazad can use alchemy to transform their excess mana to gold in 2:1 rate.

[H1]Background[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1]During the Age of Magic the dwarves were not the united nation that they would become in the Age of Winter. Scattered tribes of mountain peoples, they were skilled craftsmen and engineers but had little interest in the areas beyond their lands. Amiable and welcoming, they made perfect targets for the con-men and tricksters of other kingdoms. The greatest works of their smiths and their shapers were traded for trinkets and baubles, or worse, mere illusions that vanished when their creators were gone. The dwarves couldn't win redress from the local lords through strength of arms or force of argument. They had no great armies, and the neighboring rulers pointed out that the dwarves had, after all, agreed to the bargains.[PARAGRAPH:1]This abuse bred distrust of both foreigners and all forms of illusion and magic. It also pushed them underground. Their formerly welcoming cities built along mountain passes were slowly abandoned for safer under-hill communities. The tribes grew closer, and gradually out of many a single unified civilization was formed, the Khazad. The dwarves began to ask themselves why they ever even bothered with outsiders.[PARAGRAPH:1]Towards the end of the Age of Magic, few dwarves were seen by other races, and it was later said that deep in their under-hill holds, they didn't notice the Age of Winter for three generations. Though this is almost certainly an exaggeration, while the kingdoms of men and elves withered under Mulcarn's onslaught the dwarves grew slowly but steadily. Then one day their gatherers returned from the surface with reports of lush vegetation returning, and snow melting.[PARAGRAPH:1]Kandros Fir led one group of Khazad out of their cavernous homes, to form cities and trade with the new kingdoms of men and of elves. He does not revere tradition as most dwarves do; rather, he pioneered arts new to his people: negotiation, appraisal, marketing. He pursues trading partners with zeal, by force if necessary, always determined to advance the Khazad's fortunes. Remembering the insults they were subjected to in generations past the Khazad are determined that they be secure as they venture out into the world. Not just the security of high walls and stout hammers, but of brimming coffers and judicious merchants.[PARAGRAPH:1]While his goals draw him outward, what is unknown outside of a few dwarven circles is that internecine conflict helped push him and his followers to the surface. Both he and Arturus Thorne want the best for their people, but they are committed to different visions of achieving it. The limits of underground expansion were reached in ages past, and so both leaders must use the wider world to prove their vision for the Khazad in the age of rebirth.</English>

Khazad loves gold. This is reflected in Dwarven Vault mechanic, automatically built in Khazad cities. The vaults evaluate the amount of gold empire wid and divide that with the number of cities. If the amount of gold per city is above certain threshold, the vaults will give benefits to the cities. If the amount is low, the citizen will be unhappy.

Khazad has great synergy with Artisan's Guild since mine grants access to silver, gold, gems and ambers, which then transformed into money using buildings further down in the guild line. Since most of Khazad units require metal yield, they find the best synergy with Runes of Kilmorph, mainly for ROK's affinity with metals and mined resources, giving them even more money and metals.

One drawback of Khazad is their lack of magical aptitude. Khazad can build only adepts. They also start with Nature magic which has zero direct damage spells. Since it might be better to just use dwarven army instead of summons, Khazad can use alchemy to transform their excess mana to gold in 2:1 rate.

[H1]Background[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1]Während des Zeitalters der Magie waren die Zwerge nicht die geeinte Nation, zu der sie im Zeitalter des Winters werden würden. Sie waren verstreut lebende Bergvölker mit sehr fähigen Handwerkern und Konstrukteuren, aber sie hatten nur wenig Interesse an den Gebieten jenseits ihrer eigenen. Da sie liebenswürdig und gastfreundlich waren, waren sie beliebte Ziele von Gaunern und Betrügern aus anderen Königreichen. Die besten Arbeiten aus ihren Schmieden und Fräsen tauschten sie gegen allerlei Tand und billigen Schmuck oder, noch schlimmer, gegen bloße Illusionen, die sich auflösten, wenn deren Erschaffer weitergezogen waren. Selbst mit Waffengewalt oder zwingenden Beweisen konnten die Zwerge von den Provinzfürsten keine Entschädigung erhalten. Sie hatten keine großen Armeen zur Verfügung und die benachbarten Anführer verwiesen darauf, dass die Zwerge diesen Handeln immerhin zugestimmt hätten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Diese Ungerechtigkeit gebar Misstrauen gegenüber Fremden und jeglichen Formen der Illusion und der Magie. Außerdem trieb sie die Zwerge unter die Erde. Ihre früher einladenden Städte, die entlang der Gebirgspässe errichtet worden waren, wurden nach und nach zugunsten von sichereren unterirdischen Gemeinschaften verlassen. Die Stämme wuchsen zusammen und langsam bildete sich aus vielen Gemeinden eine einzige vereinte Nation, die Khazad. Und die Zwerge begannen sich zu fragen, weshalb sie sich jemals mit Außenstehenden abgegeben hatten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gegen Ende des Zeitalters der Magie wurden nur noch wenige Zwerge von anderen Völkern gesichtet und viel später wurde erzählt, dass die Zwerge, tief in ihren unterirdischen Festungen, das Zeitalter des Eises erst nach drei Generationen bemerkt hätten. Obwohl das mit Sicherheit eine Übertreibung ist, wuchs die Gesellschaft der Zwerge langsam aber stetig, während die Königreiche der Menschen und Elfen unter Mulcarns Ansturm vergingen. Bis eines Tages ihre Sammler mit Berichten über saftige Vegetation und das Schmelzen des Schnees von der Oberfläche zurückkehrten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Kandros Fir führte eine Gruppe der Khazad aus ihren Höhlenbehausungen heraus, um neue Städte zu gründen und Handel mit den neuen Reichen der Menschen und Elfen zu treiben. Er ist kein Sklave der Traditionen, wie es die meisten Zwerge sind, sondern bereitete den Weg für Fähigkeiten, die seinem Volk unbekannt waren: Verhandlungsgeschick, Begutachtung und Vermarktung. Er überzeugt seine Handelspartner mit Eifer, auch mit Gewalt, falls nötig, und ist immer darauf bedacht, den Reichtum der Khazad zu mehren. Obwohl sie sich an die Ungerechtigkeiten erinnern, die vergangene Generationen erdulden mussten, sind die Khazad davon überzeugt, dass sie nun selbstsicher durch die Welt reisen können. Und zwar nicht nur mit der Selbstsicherheit von hohen Mauern und starken Hämmern, sondern auch mit jener von überlaufenden Schatzkammern und umsichtigen Kaufleuten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Vordergründig führten seine Ziele Kandros Fir nach draußen, aber, was außerhalb bestimmter zwergischer Kreise nicht bekannt ist, auch ein mörderischer Konflikt zwang ihn und seine Anhänger, an die Oberfläche zu gehen. Er und Arturus Thorne wollen nur das Beste für ihr Volk, aber sie hatten unterschiedliche Ansichten darüber, wie das zu erreichen sei. Die Grenzen der Ausbreitung im Untergrund wurden schon vor langer Zeit erreicht und nun müssen beide Anführer Gebrauch von der weiten Welt machen, um die Tauglichkeit ihrer Vorstellungen für die weitere Entwicklung der Khazad im Zeitalter der Wiedergeburt unter Beweis stellen.</German>

[H1]Background[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1]The nucleus of the Kuriotates was formed in the harrowing years between the end of the Age of Ice and the dawn of the Age of Rebirth. Squabbling tribes, clans, warlords and embryonic city-states were gathered into a small nation led by the boy-king Cardith Lorda. It is in this background that we find the secret behind the Kuriotates' rather odd societal structure. All these diverse elements gathered together in a sheltered and bountiful land, and started to forge a state that could survive in a dangerous world. However, the mutual distrust between all the clans, families and dynasties Cardith Lorda brought together means that they will not suffer another to grow more powerful than they are. In effect, the lower levels of government in the core regions are marked by a form of democracy, watched over by a royal administration with complete control.[PARAGRAPH:1]Thus, all expansion is conducted by the King, and by him alone, and all territory is royal territory. The army swears allegiance to the king alone, and all administrative functions flow from the state rather than a master-servant system. There is no feudal system among the Kuriotates. The powerful live in the cities, and compete for positions there. In the outlying areas, the powerful are only powerful by royal decree, and Cardith Lorda's careful machinations ensures that it stays that way. Thus arose the system of settlements.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Kuriotates are a confederation of peoples and races, marked by a very powerful core region, vast areas more loosely connected to the core cities, and full freedom of asylum, even citizenship, for those who wish to move from other nations or the wilderness of uncivilized territory. The settlements, controlled solely by the central administration (i.e., Cardith Lorda's government) act as administrative centers, tying vast areas, often with their own highly advanced semi-autonomous indigenous populations, into the Kuriotate confederacy. The settlements provide facilities for transit, trade, administration and diplomacy in the affiliated regions, but never develop a very large population of pure Kuriotates. They are mostly populated by bureaucrats, merchants, a handful of soldiers and their families and the most promising born here quickly relocate to the central cities. A system of trade and friendship with their centre on the small Kuriotate settlements keeps the hodge-podge of allies, protectorates, semi-autonomies and client states happy and ensures that much-needed resources continue to flow to the core lands.[PARAGRAPH:1]The vast areas with sparse human population that get locked within the Kuriotates' disproportionately large sphere of influence and cultural domination mean that they get in contact with many of the rarer species of Erebus. For many civilizations, that might prove problematic, even act as a source of conflict and destruction. For the Kuriotates, it is a boon, and a source of their strength.[PARAGRAPH:1]For the Kuriotates don't much care who you are as long as you have something meaningful to offer to the nation as a whole. The Kuriotates' particularly positive relationship to the non-human species of Erebus dates back to the very beginnings of the confederation, when a small group of centaurs aided Cardith Lorda in his rise to power. Other creatures, attracted by the special power they detect in the boy king, have since flocked to the Kuriotate banner, escaping marginalization or even persecution in other parts of the world. The centaurs, having risen to be a force to be reckoned with in Kuriotate political life, smooth their transition and integration into the society, putting their special skills to good use in the areas at which they excel, through innate ability or cultural conditioning.[PARAGRAPH:1]The culture of the Kuriotates is such that the demi-humans are treated as, and indeed regarded as being, equal to the human majority, and judged by merit and benefit to the nation alone, although the fundamental differences between the races mean that some measure of distinction is necessary in order to allow the Kuriotate nation to run smoothly. However, again this may be a secret benefit.[PARAGRAPH:1]This specialization and segregation has given rise to something akin to a caste system, another reason the Kuriotates have such a stable central government. While the humans are the jack of all trades, each of the races has found its own niche. The centaurs, the warrior caste, hold many high positions in the army, the lamia wield great magical power, and command respect among the magi, and so on. Since all these subcultures owe allegiance to the king alone, they act, in their specialized roles, as an effective bulwark against the ambitions of human noblemen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Those few dissidents who let their resentment at being bypassed be channeled into irrational hatred of demi-humans are held in check by strong personal trust in Cardith Lorda and an emphasis on the state religion, not to mention state superstition and traditions. Few Kuriotates dare cross or even question the will of the state, the will of the people of the confederation, and most importantly, the will of the divine Boy-King.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Kuriotates hold loose sway over a massive sprawl of an empire, but the borders are porous, and when war threatens, they will often act as a turtle, retreating into the hard shell of their core lands until they can muster the forces to take back that which was lost. Thus, the Kuriotates through their openness to others, strong central authority and large but loose sphere of influence have a flexibility many of their opponents lack.

[H1]Background[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1]Der Kern der Kuriotaten entstand in den qualvollen Jahren zwischen dem Ende des Zeitalters des Eises und dem Anbruch des Zeitalters der Wiedergeburt. Zänkische Stämme, Klans, Kriegsherren und aufkeimende Stadtstaaten scharten sich zu einer kleinen Nation zusammen, die vom Kindkönig Cardith Lorda angeführt wurde. Auf Grund dieser Vergangenheit klärt sich das Geheimnis hinter der ziemlich ungewöhnlichen Gesellschaftsstruktur der Kuriotaten. In einem üppigen und gut behüteten Landstrich versammelten sich all diese verschiedenen Elemente und begannen, einen Staat zu schmieden, der in einer gefährlichen Welt überleben könnte. Das gegenseitige Misstrauen unter allen Klans, Familien und Dynastien, die Cardith Lorda zusammenbrachte, bedeutet jedoch, dass niemand einen Machtzuwachs eines anderen zulassen wird. Tatsächlich sind die unteren Ebenen der Verwaltung in den Kernregionen durch eine Art von Demokratie gekennzeichnet, die aber von einer königlichen Verwaltung überwacht wird, die wiederum über absolute Kontrolle verfügt.[PARAGRAPH:1]Deshalb wird jede Ausdehnung des Reiches vom König betrieben, und zwar nur von ihm, und jegliches Land ist königliches Land. Die Armee schwört einzig und allein dem König Treue und alle administrativen Funktionen werden vom Staat ausgeübt, statt von einem System aus Herren und Dienern. Es gibt bei den Kuriotaten kein feudales System. Die Mächtigen leben in den Städten und konkurrieren dort um Positionen. In den abgelegenen Gebieten sind die Mächtigen nur auf Grund eines königlichen Erlasses mächtig und Cardith Lordas Intrigen sorgen dafür, dass das so bleibt. Daraus enstand das System der Siedlungen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Kuriotaten sind ein Bündnis von Völkern und Rassen, das sich durch eine sehr starke Kernregion, weite Landstriche, die nur lose mit den Kernstädten verbunden sind, und volle Ansiedlungsfreiheit, sogar der Möglichkeit zur Staatsbürgerschaft, für jene auszeichnet, die anderen Nationen oder der Wildnis der unzivilisierten Gebiete den Rücken kehren wollen. Die Siedlungen, die ausschließlich von der zentralen Verwaltung kontrolliert werden (also von Cardith Lordas Regierung), vebinden als Verwaltungszentren weite Landstriche, in denen oft eine hochentwickelte, halbautonome einheimische Bevölkerung zu finden ist, mit der kuriotatischen Konförderation. Die Siedlungen stellen Möglichkeiten für Transport, Handel, Verwaltung und Diplomatie in den angebundenen Regionen bereit, brigen aber nie eine große Anzahl von reinen Kuriotaten hervor. Die Bevölkerung setzt sich meistens aus Bürokraten, Händlern, einer Handvoll Soldaten und deren Familien zusammen, während jene, die dort geboren werden und am vielversprechendsten erscheinen, schnell in die Kernstädte auswandern. Ein System aus Handel und Freundschaft, dessen Zentren sich in den kleinen kuriotatischen Siedlungen befinden, hält das Sammelsurium aus Verbündeten, Protektoraten, halbautonomen Gebieten und Satellitenstaaten bei Laune und stellt sicher, dass dringend benötigte Ressourcen weiterhin das Kernland erreichen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Durch die weiten Landstriche mit ihren spärlichen menschlichen Ansiedlungen, die in der unverhältnismäßig großen Sphäre des Einflusses und der kulturellen Vorherrschaft der Kuriotaten eingeschlossen sind, kommen sie auch mit vielen der selteneren Spezies von Erebus in Kontakt. Für viele Zivilisationen würde sich das zumindest als problematisch erweisen, wenn nicht sogar als eine Quelle für Konflikte und Zerstörung. Für die Kuriotaten ist es ein Segen und eine Quelle ihrer Stärke.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Kuriotaten kümmert es kaum, wer man ist, solange man der Nation als Ganzes etwas Bedeutsames anzubieten hat. Das besonders gute Verhältnis der Kuriotaten zu den nichtmenschlichen Spezies von Erebus kann zu den Anfängen der Konföderation zurückgeführt werden, als eine kleine Gruppe Zentauren Cardith Lorda bei seinem Aufstieg zur Macht halfen. Auch andere Kreaturen, die sich von der besonderen Aura angezogen fühlten, die sie in dem Kindkönig verspürten, haben sich seitdem unter dem Banner der Kuriotaten versammelt, um der Bedeutungslosigkeit oder sogar der Verfolgung in anderen Teilen der Welt zu entgehen. Die Zentauren, die im politischen Leben der Kuriotaten zu einer ernstzunehmenden Kraft geworden sind, ebnen sich ihren Übergang und ihre Eingliederung in die Gesellschaft, indem sie zum Vorteil aller ihre speziellen Fähigkeiten auf Gebieten einsetzen, in denen sie sich besonders auszeichnen, sei es durch angeborenes Geschick oder durch kulturelle Konditionierung.[PARAGRAPH:1]In der Kultur der Kuriotaten werden Halbmenschen als gleichberechtigt mit der menschlichen Mehrheit betrachtet und tatsächlich auch so behandelt, nur die Leistung und die Verdienste für das Reich zählen. Allerdings bedeutet die grundlegende Verschiedenheit der Völker auch, dass es irgendein Maß für die Unterscheidung geben muss, um die Handlungsfähigkeit des kuriotatischen Reichs zu erhalten. Dies könnte jedoch auch ein weiterer verborgener Vorteil sein.[PARAGRAPH:1]Diese Spezialisierung und damit auch Trennung hat zu einer Art Kastensystem geführt, das ein weiterer Grund für die stabile Zentralregierung der Kuriotaten ist. Während die Menschen Universalisten sind, haben die anderen Völker ihre eigenen Nischen gefunden, die sie beherrschen. Die Zentauren, die Kriegerkaste, haben viele hohe Posten in der Armee inne, während die Lamia über große magische Kräfte verfügen und eine Führungsrolle unter den Magiekundigen einnehmen. Da alle diese Subkulturen nur dem König Treue schuldig sind, stellen sie mit ihren spezialisierten Funktionen ein wirksames Bollwerk gegen die Bestrebungen menschlicher Adliger dar.[PARAGRAPH:1]Jene wenigen Andersdenkenden, deren Groll sich in einen irrationalen Hass auf Halbmenschen wandelt, wenn sie übergangen werden, werden durch starkes persönliches Vertrauen in Cardith Lorda und die Betonung der Staatsreligion in Schach gehalten, ganz zu schweigen von staatlichem Aberglauben und den Traditionen. Nur wenige Kuriotaten wagen es, den Willen des Staates, den Willen der Völker der Konföderation und, was am wichtigsten ist, den Willen des göttlichen Kindkönigs in Frage zu stellen oder ihm gar zuwiderzuhandeln.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Kuriotaten üben zwar nur eine lose Herrschaft über die riesige Ausdehnung ihres Reiches aus, aber die Grenzen sind durchlässig, und wenn Krieg droht, verhalten sie sich meist wie eine Schildkröte, die sich in den harten Panzer der Kernländer zurückzieht, bis sie die Streitkräfte aufstellen können, um das zurückzuholen, was verloren ging. Durch die Offenheit anderen gegenüber, eine starke zentrale Autorität und ihr großes, aber nur lose beherrschtes, Einflussgebiet besitzen die Kuriotaten eine Vielseitigkeit, an der es vielen ihrer Gegner mangelt. Sie sind wahrhaft eines der Zentren der Erleuchtung im Dunkel von Erebus.</German>

[H1]Background[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1]The nucleus of the Kuriotates was formed in the harrowing years between the end of the Age of Ice and the dawn of the Age of Rebirth. Squabbling tribes, clans, warlords and embryonic city-states were gathered into a small nation led by the boy-king Cardith Lorda. It is in this background that we find the secret behind the Kuriotates' rather odd societal structure. All these diverse elements gathered together in a sheltered and bountiful land, and started to forge a state that could survive in a dangerous world. However, the mutual distrust between all the clans, families and dynasties Cardith Lorda brought together means that they will not suffer another to grow more powerful than they are. In effect, the lower levels of government in the core regions are marked by a form of democracy, watched over by a royal administration with complete control.[PARAGRAPH:1]Thus, all expansion is conducted by the King, and by him alone, and all territory is royal territory. The army swears allegiance to the king alone, and all administrative functions flow from the state rather than a master-servant system. There is no feudal system among the Kuriotates. The powerful live in the cities, and compete for positions there. In the outlying areas, the powerful are only powerful by royal decree, and Cardith Lorda's careful machinations ensures that it stays that way. Thus arose the system of settlements.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Kuriotates are a confederation of peoples and races, marked by a very powerful core region, vast areas more loosely connected to the core cities, and full freedom of asylum, even citizenship, for those who wish to move from other nations or the wilderness of uncivilized territory. The settlements, controlled solely by the central administration (i.e., Cardith Lorda's government) act as administrative centers, tying vast areas, often with their own highly advanced semi-autonomous indigenous populations, into the Kuriotate confederacy. The settlements provide facilities for transit, trade, administration and diplomacy in the affiliated regions, but never develop a very large population of pure Kuriotates. They are mostly populated by bureaucrats, merchants, a handful of soldiers and their families and the most promising born here quickly relocate to the central cities. A system of trade and friendship with their centre on the small Kuriotate settlements keeps the hodge-podge of allies, protectorates, semi-autonomies and client states happy and ensures that much-needed resources continue to flow to the core lands.[PARAGRAPH:1]The vast areas with sparse human population that get locked within the Kuriotates' disproportionately large sphere of influence and cultural domination mean that they get in contact with many of the rarer species of Erebus. For many civilizations, that might prove problematic, even act as a source of conflict and destruction. For the Kuriotates, it is a boon, and a source of their strength.[PARAGRAPH:1]For the Kuriotates don't much care who you are as long as you have something meaningful to offer to the nation as a whole. The Kuriotates' particularly positive relationship to the non-human species of Erebus dates back to the very beginnings of the confederation, when a small group of centaurs aided Cardith Lorda in his rise to power. Other creatures, attracted by the special power they detect in the boy king, have since flocked to the Kuriotate banner, escaping marginalization or even persecution in other parts of the world. The centaurs, having risen to be a force to be reckoned with in Kuriotate political life, smooth their transition and integration into the society, putting their special skills to good use in the areas at which they excel, through innate ability or cultural conditioning.[PARAGRAPH:1]The culture of the Kuriotates is such that the demi-humans are treated as, and indeed regarded as being, equal to the human majority, and judged by merit and benefit to the nation alone, although the fundamental differences between the races mean that some measure of distinction is necessary in order to allow the Kuriotate nation to run smoothly. However, again this may be a secret benefit.[PARAGRAPH:1]This specialization and segregation has given rise to something akin to a caste system, another reason the Kuriotates have such a stable central government. While the humans are the jack of all trades, each of the races has found its own niche. The centaurs, the warrior caste, hold many high positions in the army, the lamia wield great magical power, and command respect among the magi, and so on. Since all these subcultures owe allegiance to the king alone, they act, in their specialized roles, as an effective bulwark against the ambitions of human noblemen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Those few dissidents who let their resentment at being bypassed be channeled into irrational hatred of demi-humans are held in check by strong personal trust in Cardith Lorda and an emphasis on the state religion, not to mention state superstition and traditions. Few Kuriotates dare cross or even question the will of the state, the will of the people of the confederation, and most importantly, the will of the divine Boy-King.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Kuriotates hold loose sway over a massive sprawl of an empire, but the borders are porous, and when war threatens, they will often act as a turtle, retreating into the hard shell of their core lands until they can muster the forces to take back that which was lost. Thus, the Kuriotates through their openness to others, strong central authority and large but loose sphere of influence have a flexibility many of their opponents lack.

[H1]Background[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1]Als die grausamen Monstren mit der Unterzeichnung des Paktes aus den Meeren verschwanden, breiteten sich die Menschen auf ihnen aus und diese ersten Entdecker waren die Vorfahren der Lanun. Es gab zwar immer noch Monster wie die Leviathane und Riesenschildkröten, gegen die sie sich behaupten mussten, aber diese waren kein unüberwindbares Hindernis für die mutigen Mannschaften der frühen, leckgeplagten Trieren und der späteren Triremen. Danalin bot diesen Menschen seine Führung an und sie schlossen Freundschaft mit den sonst eher unzugänglichen Aifons, diesem Volk, das dem Meeresgott am nächsten stand und in Unterwasserstädten lebte. Lanunische Inselgemeinden entstanden, von denen jede eigene Gebräuche entwickelte, die aber dennoch viele der Werte mit den lanunischen Küstenstädten auf dem Festland gemein hatten, nämlich die Freiheits- und Abenteuerliebe, die Listigkeit und einen dehnbaren Ehrbegriff. Als Kylorin seine Herrschaft über Patria gefestigt hatte und damit begann, benachbarte Königreiche seinem Imperium einzuverleiben, mit Gewalt, falls nötig, schlossen sich ihm die weit entfernten Lanun freiwillig an. Allerdings sie kümmerten sich nur um die Durchsetzung jener Gesetze, mit denen sie einverstanden waren, und erlaubten Flüchtlingen, an Bord von Schiffen zu entkommen und ihr Heil auf den Wellen zu suchen. Gelegentlich wurde eine lanunische Stadt dafür bestraft, obwohl ihre Handelsverbindungen sie eigentlich viel zu wertvoll machten, um an ihnen ein Exempel zu statuieren. Bald zerfiel Patria, als Kriege zwischen den boshaften Magiern und jenen ausbrachen, die nach Erlösung für die Welt der Menschen trachteten. Die Lanun unterstützten geschickterweise beide Seiten, indem sie fliehenden Magiern über das Meer halfen und anschließend den patrianischen Feuerpriestern, die sie zur Strecke bringen sollten, Schiffe verkauften. Dann wurde ihre Welt von den Göttern erschüttert, als Bhalls Feuerregen und Mulcarns Eroberungsfeldzug ganze Zivilisationen zerschmetterten. Die Ozeane wurden durch riesige Eisberge, die ein Schiff in Stücke reißen konnten, bevor man sie überhaupt sah, noch gefährlicher und einige lanunische Gemeinschaften wurden durch die sich ausbreitenden Eismassen tatsächlich vollkommen isoliert. Die Seefahrer der Lanun mussten während dieser Zeit mit einer weiteren Gefahr kämpfen, denn ihre Priester verloren den Kontakt zu Danalin und ihre Rituale begannen, unvorhergesehene Verläufe zu nehmen. Jene lanunischen Mannschaften, die immer noch willens waren, den Meeren zu trotzen, erlangten großen Ruhm und Reichtum, indem sie den Handel zwischen fernen Stämmen ermöglichten, auch wenn sie dabei oft Opfer von Schneestürmen wurden und von vielen Mannschaften nie wieder etwas gehört wurde, einschließlich des Schiffes von Kapitän Malus, das ein Artefakt von Cassiel in das Land der Amuriten bringen sollte.[PARAGRAPH:1]Schließlich wich das Eis zurück und die Lanun wurden wieder vereint. Aber sie mussten feststellen, dass sie einander kaum mehr kannten, da Mannschaften an unterschiedlichen Orten völlig andere Auffassungen und Werte entwickelt hatten. Das war allerdings kein Problem für die Lanun, da jeder Kapitän sein Schiff auf die Art führt, die er für angebracht hält. Die eigentliche Macht im Reich der Lanun liegt bei den Kapitänen, da diese im Rang über Provinzgouverneuren stehen, und jeden aus irgendeinem Grund zwangsrekrutieren können. Die einzige Autorität, die ein lanunischer Kapitän im Rang über sich anerkennt, ist ein anderer Kapitän, dem er sein Ehrenwort gegeben hat, auch wenn das Wort eines Lanun von eher flüchtiger Natur ist. Das wirkliche Problem ist nun, dass der Ozean nicht mehr so einladend ist wie einst, und während sie früher die Hilfe des Gott des Wassers erbitten konnten, verhallen diese Bitten nun ungehört, oder werden, noch schlimmer, von seltsamen Kreaturen, die aus den Tiefen aufsteigen, beantwortet.[PARAGRAPH:1]Einige Kapitäne bewahren sich trotz dieser neuen Herausforderung den unbekümmerten Geist ihres Volkes, während andere, wie Hannah die Irin, das dunklere Wesen begrüßen, das die Ozeane angenommen haben. Falamar sieht sich selbst als schneidigen Schurken. Er pflegt, die Opfer seiner Raubzüge nicht zu töten (da er der Meinung ist, dass sie dann davon abgehalten würden, ihm noch mehr Beute zu bringen). Außerdem ist er ein ausgezeichneter Schwertkämpfer und ein galanter Anführer. Dagegen ist Hannah das komplette Gegenteil dessen. Sie ist der personifizierte Sturm, launenhaft und mächtig. Sie hat wegen einer vermeintlichen Beleidigung schon ganze Städte niederreißen lassen und herrscht nicht mit Anmut, sondern mit Schrecken. Welche Auffassung sich im neuen Zeitalter als erfolgreich herausstellen wird, wird sich erst noch zeigen müssen, aber bei den Lanun ist wie immer Raum für jeden Kapitän vorhanden, um seine oder ihre eigene Route wählen zu können.</German>

Lanun has good synergy with Cult of Esus with three of their unique units are unlocked in this guild. While this does not necessarily make Lanun player evil, adopting Cult of Esus does enable various dirty tricks to employ.

Other guild important to Lanun might be the Merchant Quarter. Adopting this guild will provide Lanun player access to various trade-related buildings and ships. When mastering the guild, Lanun can build War Tortoise, amphibian unit strong both in waters and lands.

Lanun's weakness is its military strength, especially early and mid game. Lanun has lower than average unit strength and variety. Their Wench can cast Charm Person to mitigate this somewhat but still, Lanun player needs to seek for strong military units from other sources.

[H1]Background[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1]As the ferocious monsters were removed from the seas with the signing of the Compact, man expanded into them, and these first explorers were the ancestors of the Lanun. There were still beasts such as leviathans and giant turtles to contend with, but these were not insurmountable obstacles to the brave men on those early, leaky galleys and later triremes. Danalin offered these men his guidance, and they formed friendships with the otherwise elusive Aifons, those men most close to the sea god who lived in underwater cities. Island communities of Lanun developed, each with their own customs, but sharing most of the values of the mainland coastal Lanun cities, a love of freedom and adventure, guile, and a flexible sense of honor. When Kylorin solidified his rule of Patria and began to incorporate neighboring kingdoms into his empire, by force if needed, the distant Lanun freely pledged. They only bothered to enforce those laws they agreed with, however, and allowed fugitives to flee aboard ship and seek their fortunes on the waves. Occasionally a Lanun city would be punished for this, though their trade routes made them too valuable to make an example of. Patria soon collapsed, as wars broke out between the wicked mages and those seeking redemption for the world of men. The Lanun happily aided both sides, taking fleeing mages across the waves and then selling ships to the Patrian fire priests seeking them down. Then their world was shaken by the gods, as Bhall's rain of fire and Mulcarn's conquest brought civilizations crashing down. The seas were made more hazardous by huge icebergs that could tear a ship to pieces before being seen, and some Lanun communities were in fact completely isolated by encroaching ice. Further imperiling Lanun seafarers during this time, their priests lost all contact with Danalin, and their rituals began to behave in unexpected ways. Those Lanun crews who were still willing to brave the seas found great fame and wealth trading between distant tribes, though this often made them a target of the blizzards and many crews were never heard from again, including the ship captained by Malus which carried an artifact from Cassiel into Amurite lands.[PARAGRAPH:1] Eventually the ice receded, and the Lanun were reunited. They found they barely knew their kin, as crew in different locations had evolved quite different outlooks and values. This wasn't a problem for the Lanun, though, for each captain rules his own ship in the manner he sees fit. The sea captains are where the real power in Lanun territory lies, for captains outrank provincial governors and can conscript any person for any reason. The only authority a Lanun captain acknowledges over him is another captain to whom he has given his word, though as always the word of a Lanun is somewhat fleeting. The real problem is that the ocean is no longer quite as welcoming as it once was, and whereas they could before seek the aid the God of Water, those petitions are unheeded now, or worse, answered by strange creatures that emerge from the depths. [PARAGRAPH:1]Some Lanun captains retain the carefree spirit of their people despite this new challenge, while others, like Hannah the Irin, embrace the darker nature the seas have taken. Falamar sees himself as a dashing rogue. He tends not to kill the victims of his raids (claiming that would keep them from bringing him more loot), and he is an excellent swordsman and charming leader. Hannah is everything he isn't. She is the storm personified, temperamental and powerful. She has had entire cities razed for a perceived insult, and rules not by charm, but by fear. Which view will prove more effective in the new age is yet to be seen, but as always there is room in the Lanun for each captain to choose his or her own path.</Spanish>

Ljosalfar devotes most of its military prowess in archery units. Fyrdwell is one of few archery units with movement of 2. Flurry starts with Blitz and Marksman, fit to snipe weaker units in enemy stack. Unlike other civs which use archery units as city defenders, Ljosalfar's archers are capable attackers. Player might want to select Skirmish discipline to give extra mobility for Ljosalfar archers.

Ljosalfar has great synergy with the Fellowship of the Leaves. Elves are agile in the forest and can build improvements without destroying the forest. Many promotions for archers give further benefits when in forest. For guild, the first to unlock should be Ranger's Guild since it allows player to take advantage of Deer, an essential resource to unlock Fyrdwell. Ranger's Guild also increases leather and lumber yields, required to build most of Ljosalfar army.

While Nature magic will help Ljosalfar maintaining their economy and provide more muscle through various summons, Nature magic's lack of direct damage spells hurts Ljosalfar, especially during sieges. To mitigate this, Ljosalfar player should acquire another types of mana, preferably one that will not burn their forests.

[H1]Background[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1]Dwarves do not always live in caves. The Empire of Kradh-Ke-zun, the Open-Skiers, suffered terrible losses during the Age of Ice precisely because they, as opposed to their cousins the Khazad, had adapted to a life on the surface and forgotten the secrets of making their lives in the subterranean world. Fantastic craftsmen, cunning artificers, and proficient enchanters, the Kradh-Ke-zun were creators of some of the greatest artifacts of the Age of Magic, not least of which were the golems: golems for war, golems for transport, golems for farming, for mining and for industry. Life, for the Open-Skiers with their endless supply of infallibly obedient servants, was good, and the people thrived.[PARAGRAPH:1]The new reality of the Age of Ice was harsh on the Open-Skiers. When the glaciers rolled forth, strangling life, isolating populations, and crushing cities beneath tons of grinding blue ice, the Luchuirp watched helplessly as the cunning devices they had entrusted so much of their survival to succumbed to the long winter.[PARAGRAPH:1]Three-foot-tall city dwellers are not adapted to the rigorous, marginal, nomadic existence of Ice Age hunters, and few survived for long. Of the once mighty empire of great cities, thriving farmlands and millions of contented citizens, only one particularly hardy clan survived: the Luchuirp. Though weakened by the dominance of Mulcarn, Kilmorph still managed to hold a warding hand over this little tribe of surface-dwelling dwarves. She came to the leader, the now-legendary Graoin the Delver, and taught him the things his people had forgotten: how to dig, how to build homes under the mountain. Combining this with what little of their incredible artistry and golem mastery they could still make use of, they fashioned themselves a society of sorts in the caves beneath the Ice, and they waited, knowing that one day, the clan of Luchuirp, heirs of the Open-Skiers, would once again walk under the sun.[PARAGRAPH:1]Beeri Bawl is a true heir to Graoin the Delver, not only in blood, but in spirit. He is a survivalist by nature, organized and effective, but he has never forgotten his roots and his ancestry. His highest goal is to reclaim a spot on the surface, but that does not mean he intends to make the mistake of his forefathers and neglect the lower reaches of the world.

Sie erschien deren Anführer, dem inzwischen legendären Graoin dem Gräber und brachte ihm jene Dinge bei, die sein Volk vergessen hatte: wie man in die Tiefe gräbt, wie man Behausungen in den Berg hinein treibt. Zusammen mit dem verbliebenen Rest ihrer unglaublichen Handwerkskunst und der Golembeherrschung, von dem sie noch Gebrauch machen konnten, erschufen sie sich in den Höhlen unter dem Eis eine Art von Gesellschaft und warteten.

Combinando esto con lo poco de su increíble artesanía y maestría de Golems que podían aplicar aún, se crearon algún tipo de sociedad en las cuevas bajo el hielo, y esperaron, sabiendo que algún día el Clan Luchuirp, hijos de los Esquiadores-Abiertos, caminarían de nuevo bajo el sol.[PARAGRAPH:1]Beeri Bawl es un verdadero heredero de Graoin el Ahondador, no sólo por sangre, sino por espírito. Es un superviviente por naturaleza, organizado y eficiente, pero nunca ha olvidado sus raíces y a sus ancestros. Su principal objetivo es reclamar un lugar en la superficie, pero eso no significa que intente cometer el error de sus parientes y negar las profundidades de la tierra. Su intento es una simbiosis de la refinada artesanía del viejo Imperio y la dura lección aprendida por los Luchuirp en la Edad de Hielo.</Spanish>

Sidar is good civ for players who love to turtle. With their unique GE, Hidden City, Sidar cities have extra protection against enemy units attacking them. Further mastery in Air magic can strengthen the mist protecting their cities.

Sidar version of Training Yards, Barracks and War Academies do not increase unit supply slot but can train units stationed in the city. Thus, Sidar tends to employ fewer units but each of their units will have higher level than other civs.

Normalement, la Cour Seelie aurait attendu le printemps pour changer cette décision mais le printemps ne vint jamais et l'Age de Glace commença. La Cour UnSeelie y vit un symbole de sa domination et commença à punir les elfes qui refusaient d'arrêter de vénérer Sucellus. Cela causa une guerre civile sanglante pour la nation elfe à une époque où leur nombre était déjà fortement réduit.

Der Gesegnete Hof (der gerechtere und spirituellere) herrschte während Frühling und Sommer und der Sündige Hof (der magischere und böswilligere) in Herbst und Winter. Als Sucellus starb, blieben die Gebete der Elfen ungehört. Weil in dem Moment, als dies geschah, der Sündige Hof die Macht inne hatte, verkündete dessen Königin, dass der Gott der Elfen tot sei und Esus nun an seine Stelle treten würde. Normalerweise hätte der Gesegnete Hof im Frühling diese Entscheidung rückgängig machen können, aber der Frühling kam nie, da das Zeitalter des Eises begann. Der Sündige Hof deutete das als Gunst für seine Herrschaft und begann, Elfen zu bestrafen, die weiterhin Sucellus verehrten. Zu einer Zeit, in der ihre Zahl ohnehin schon sehr gering war, löste dies einen blutigen Bürgerkrieg unter den Elfen aus. Das Zeitalter des Eises beendete den Krieg vorerst, weil die beiden Gruppen durch unüberwindliche Barrieren voneinander getrennt wurden. Nun da das Zeitalter des Eises vorüber ist, können sie wieder ausziehen und den Krieg von neuem beginnen.</German>

        <English>Everything was destroyed. Johnathon's home city had been turned to ash by a single, terrible man who dressed as a king and warped minds with words. His family was dead. The Bannor empire was crumbling, and he knew it. The Hell they had escaped those many years ago had come for them, and this time, it was succeeding. But Johnathon had escaped, and fled to seek the single glimmer of hope that shined in the black night of the living hell Erebus had become.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]He and a ragged band of survivors were seeking something that was only spoken of in whispers and rumors: the Paradise. A land untouched by Hell, if only they could slip unnoticed through Balseraph territory. It was probably a rumor, a fool's dream, if not an outright trap. But what else was there? Foolish dreams, at least, were better than despair. Those who died did so believing that their children, brethren, or friends might make it to Paradise instead.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Nobody prayed. Junil had failed. Lugus had forsaken them. Kilmorph gave nothing. Some had even turned in desperation to the Overlords, but they had also given up Erebus to the might of Agares. But it was said that even Agares himself could not touch Paradise.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To pass the time, the survivors swapped stories of woe; there were no other kinds. An elderly man, among the oldest of the group but still relatively healthy, said, I hear the Doviello fell. Utterly destroyed. Never thought I'd be so sad to hear that news. There were nods of agreement; the beastmen had been as fierce and unforgiving as animals, but at least they were better than the Infernals.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There was a time of silence, then another piped in. They say there's a fourth horseman. It's only a guess... something has been leaving a trail of devastation worse than the other three. No prisoners, no survivors, villages just... disappear. Things were getting worse and worse.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Said yet another, can't be any nastier than the third. Disease and death followed him everywhere... I've only heard, people who actually see him tend to die horrible deaths from the diseases... provided he doesn't kill them first.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A younger man put in what he'd heard: they say the first horseman, the King, tried to invade Paradise. Gasps and murmurs of horror. But they killed him! Yeah, they killed him and took his crown! Been getting ready to do the same to the other two... three now, I guess. Most wanted the tale to be true, but doubted it. Could the Horsemen be slain at all? [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Said another, even if so, what about the Balseraphs? They're near as bad as the Infernals. Think it's all just some grand game, love nothing more than torturing people. Break their souls, make them worship Agares so they can turn them into demons. But not before breaking their bodies and minds... entertainment, they reckon it is. Horrifying. Every Balseraph is just a demon in a human-shaped egg, says I. Nods of agreement.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]They'd encountered Balseraphs before, a few times, and each had been a desperate fight. The survivors couldn't afford to take prisoners or leave any Balseraphs to report their existence, and they dare not be captured alive themselves, so each encounter was a savage struggle to the death. After the first encounter, cannibalism had also become accepted policy; they couldn't afford to waste food or leave bodies.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There was a change in the plains of ash ahead. The eldest of the group smiled from ear to ear. Come on! he yelled as he ran, with suprising speed, towards what seemed to be another ashen plain. The rest of the group, inspired if somewhat confused, tried to keep pace.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When the old man reached the change in ash, he scooped the new stuff up. Except it wasn't ash. It was a strange, pure white powder, which the old man clumped into a ball and, grinning like a child, threw at Johnathon. It was cold, and upon touching Johnathon, began to turn into water. Snow! the old man yelled. It's snow! It's been too long since I've seen snow! He laughed and danced. This is it! We've made it! The Illian Empire! Hell has no power here! Paradise![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The air grew cold surprisingly fast as the group dragged itself towards the promised land. A rabbit, white as the snow around it, examined them. It was the first non-demonic animal they had seen for months, sometimes years. The youngest Bannor stared, half expecting it to bare razor sharp teeth, spit fire at them, or roar. But it seemed as frightened of them as they were of it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A hunter, previously invisible, swathed in furs, appeared and speared the creature. He grabbed his catch, then noticed the ragged band approaching. More refugees? By Auric... luckily for you, I've been told we need all the hands we can get, but first things first. Listen up, and listen well. I am to have you take the Oath. The group stopped, and listened. Do you agree to abandon your old gods? The survivors nodded. One said, they abandoned us first! So they did, said the hunter. Do you agree to serve Auric, in this world and the next? Again, they gave their consent. Do you agree to abide by the laws and customs of the Illian people? And again, they agreed. Then I welcome you... the hunter couldn't even finish his sentence before the group cheered.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Paradise" by KillerClown </English>

The eldest of the group smiled from ear to ear. Come on! he yelled as he ran, with suprising speed, towards what seemed to be another ashen plain. The rest of the group, inspired if somewhat confused, tried to keep pace.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When the old man reached the change in ash, he scooped the new stuff up. Except it wasn't ash. It was a strange, pure white powder, which the old man clumped into a ball and, grinning like a child, threw at Johnathon. It was cold, and upon touching Johnathon, began to turn into water. Snow! the old man yelled. It's snow! It's been too long since I've seen snow! He laughed and danced. This is it! We've made it! The Illian Empire! Hell has no power here! Paradise![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The air grew cold surprisingly fast as the group dragged itself towards the promised land. A rabbit, white as the snow around it, examined them. It was the first non-demonic animal they had seen for months, sometimes years. The youngest Bannor stared, half expecting it to bare razor sharp teeth, spit fire at them, or roar. But it seemed as frightened of them as they were of it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A hunter, previously invisible, swathed in furs, appeared and speared the creature. He grabbed his catch, then noticed the ragged band approaching. More refugees? By Auric... luckily for you, I've been told we need all the hands we can get, but first things first. Listen up, and listen well. I am to have you take the Oath. The group stopped, and listened. Do you agree to abandon your old gods? The survivors nodded. One said, they abandoned us first! So they did, said the hunter. Do you agree to serve Auric, in this world and the next? Again, they gave their consent. Do you agree to abide by the laws and customs of the Illian people? And again, they agreed. Then I welcome you... the hunter couldn't even finish his sentence before the group cheered.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Paradise" by KillerClown</German>
		<Italian>Everything was destroyed. Johnathon's home city had been turned to ash by a single, terrible man who dressed as a king and warped minds with words. His family was dead. The Bannor empire was crumbling, and he knew it. The Hell they had escaped those many years ago had come for them, and this time, it was succeeding. But Johnathon had escaped, and fled to seek the single glimmer of hope that shined in the black night of the living hell Erebus had become.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]He and a ragged band of survivors were seeking something that was only spoken of in whispers and rumors: the Paradise. A land untouched by Hell, if only they could slip unnoticed through Balseraph territory. It was probably a rumor, a fool's dream, if not an outright trap. But what else was there? Foolish dreams, at least, were better than despair. Those who died did so believing that their children, brethren, or friends might make it to Paradise instead.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Nobody prayed. Junil had failed. Lugus had forsaken them. Kilmorph gave nothing. Some had even turned in desperation to the Overlords, but they had also given up Erebus to the might of Agares. But it was said that even Agares himself could not touch Paradise.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To pass the time, the survivors swapped stories of woe; there were no other kinds. An elderly man, among the oldest of the group but still relatively healthy, said, I hear the Doviello fell. Utterly destroyed. Never thought I'd be so sad to hear that news. There were nods of agreement; the beastmen had been as fierce and unforgiving as animals, but at least they were better than the Infernals.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There was a time of silence, then another piped in. They say there's a fourth horseman. It's only a guess... something has been leaving a trail of devastation worse than the other three. No prisoners, no survivors, villages just... disappear. Things were getting worse and worse.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Said yet another, can't be any nastier than the third. Disease and death followed him everywhere... I've only heard, people who actually see him tend to die horrible deaths from the diseases... provided he doesn't kill them first.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A younger man put in what he'd heard: they say the first horseman, the King, tried to invade Paradise. Gasps and murmurs of horror. But they killed him! Yeah, they killed him and took his crown! Been getting ready to do the same to the other two... three now, I guess. Most wanted the tale to be true, but doubted it. Could the Horsemen be slain at all? [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Said another, even if so, what about the Balseraphs? They're near as bad as the Infernals. Think it's all just some grand game, love nothing more than torturing people. Break their souls, make them worship Agares so they can turn them into demons. But not before breaking their bodies and minds... entertainment, they reckon it is. Horrifying. Every Balseraph is just a demon in a human-shaped egg, says I. Nods of agreement.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]They'd encountered Balseraphs before, a few times, and each had been a desperate fight. The survivors couldn't afford to take prisoners or leave any Balseraphs to report their existence, and they dare not be captured alive themselves, so each encounter was a savage struggle to the death.

        <Tag>TXT_KEY_CIV_AUSTRINX_PEDIA</Tag>
        <English>[PARAGRAPH:1]Austrin is a unique civ full of nomads, travellers and peddlars. Their cities can not grow big but their nomadic life style makes them able to connect resources on most terrains without roads. Thus, it is very easy for Austrin cities to establish trade routes, both domestically or with foreign civilizations. To compensate with their small-sized cities, Austrin has special buildings, focusing on gaining commerce or increasing income from trade route.
		
Militarily, Austrin is not the strongest civilization in Erebus but they might be the most mobile. Austrin recon units are the fastest, even Svartalfar recon units grudgingly acknowledge that, and even their melee and archery units can gain extra mobility by mounting Pegasus. While it is hard for other civilization to capture the elusive Pegasi, it is easier for the Austrin to do so. Their unique Druid, the Skyrovers, are followers of Tali and are blessed with the ability to summon Pegasi.

Under the leadership of Sorah and Ecks, the Austrin embraces their nomadic lifestyle even further. They can pack whatever necessary to build a settlement through their Prepare Expedition project and allow their recon units to found a settlement in proper places. They can also swap cities, moving back and forth between various strategic places.
		
[H1]Background[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1]The Austrin are explorers. All civilizations are naturally drawn to discover what lies outside their walls - knowing of threats and opportunities is essential to their development - but for the Austrin the need is compelling. They did not exist as an organized people before the Age of Ice - they could be identified only as the loners who defied the advice of the village elders and walked the frozen lands around the village. During the time that the ice receded, they were among the first to take to the wilds. Many were surprised to see others there at all, but when they did meet they found kindred spirits.[PARAGRAPH]Eventually they began to settle, often in the furthest reaches of a windswept moor or heath. Their cities are practical constructions - roughly built yet designed to endure - where young Austrin are prepared to make their way in the world.[PARAGRAPH]The defacto leader of the Austrin is Deirdra - a prolific wanderer and self stated worshipper of Tali, though few among the Austrin have ever seen her perform any form of religious rite to prove her devotion. Those who know better realize that worshipping Tali is generally a personal matter and better suited to a mountaintop than a temple and Deirdra often travels to find such a place when she faces a difficult choice on behalf of her people. To outsiders, she is enigmatic yet charming, often seemiming whimsical - though if a foreign diplomat mistakes this for a weakness of character which can be exploited, they swiftly discover this is not the case.[PARAGRAPH]Whilst the Austrin are generally aware of and appreciate Tali's nature, his worship is not a principle religion amongst them. Their settlements often have temples dedicated to various powers, even to Kilmorph who is traditionally the antithesis of Tali (for a time a group worshipping Kilmorph became quite prominent in Telynohn, though their popularity fluctuated and waned - the Austrin often change their mind).[PARAGRAPH]More important than religion to most Austrin however is the Exploration Guild. This started as a loose group of explorers who combined their efforts to chart the surrounding lands, but has since grown to be a place of training and preparation for the young as well as a respite for those too elderly to travel the world anymore. The first charts have become atlases and the guild claims to know more about the world than even the omniscient seers of the neighbouring Amurites. Despite the wealth of knowledge the guild holds, the Austrin are still drawn to that which lies beyond their maps - the unknown.</English>

		<Italian>[PARAGRAPH:1]Austrin is a unique civ full of nomads, travellers and peddlars. Their cities can not grow big but their nomadic life style makes them able to connect resources on most terrains without roads.

Militarily, Austrin is not the strongest civilization in Erebus but they might be the most mobile.

Their unique Druid, the Skyrovers, are followers of Tali and are blessed with the ability to summon Pegasi.

Under the leadership of Sorah and Ecks, the Austrin embraces their nomadic lifestyle even further.

		<English>Jotnar are the giant kin, an assortment of races that is held together by a common ancestry and traditions. They live centred around small family groups called 'Steaddings' or 'Homestaeds', not seldom attracting some odd kin to their dwellings. Hill giants, Trolls, Fiery giants, Tritons of the sea .. even the mightiest of them - the Titans - might fall in under their banners once they unraveled the mystery of immortality. Tightly held together, slow to bear offspring and to come to action, their pure size make them a force to be considered.[NEWLINE]STRATEGY: Cities are able to work the 3rd plot ring instead of just the first 2. This greatly influence the placement of cities. The Civic 'Traditions' aid in this by reducing the maintnance cost for number of cities. Jotnar units are not built, they are born (exceptions are workers, settlers, thrall militia and some naval units). A rare and slow breed you are dependant on the emergence of new Jotnar Children and Adults, the citizens can then be upgraded into most units you need. Even settlers. And Jotnar Citizens can work the fields and break new roads while waiting to put them in use. They also slowly gains experience, so their time as Citizens are not wasted. The Jotnar can build a unique wonder after discovery of Code of Laws and Masonry that is called the Wall of the Covenant, and which holds the Barbarians at bay. A very useful wonder on maps with large landmass and active/agressive barbarians. To make sure that your units are not wasted (since you cannot massproduce them like other civilizations) build House of the Ancestors early in all cities, it gives your units the Spirit Guide promotion which gives some experience back to your other units when a unit dies.[NEWLINE]WAR: While Jotnar often cannot produce a massive amount of units in a short time, often hindered by an average of 1 units each twenty turns even with an unlimited supply of gold, they -are- giants. Many of Jotnar units are a little stronger then their normal counterparts, they ignore terrain and can often cross even mountains that allow them to attack from unexpected directions. They also do not need bring siege-machines, because each giant in himself can tear down a wall or two. Even the Jotnar Workers can bombard cities. For the devious one, Jotnar have the Hill Giants, whom can be mass produced with Hidden Nationality, often making it hard for even other players to determine if they are your units or are the real thing.</English>

And Jotnar Citizens can work the fields and break new roads while waiting to put them in use. They also slowly gains experience, so their time as Citizens are not wasted. The Jotnar can build a unique wonder after discovery of Code of Laws and Masonry that is called the Wall of the Covenant, and which holds the Barbarians at bay. A very useful wonder on maps with large landmass and active/agressive barbarians. To make sure that your units are not wasted (since you cannot massproduce them like other civilizations) build House of the Ancestors early in all cities, it gives your units the Spirit Guide promotion which gives some experience back to your other units when a unit dies.[NEWLINE]WAR: While Jotnar often cannot produce a massive amount of units in a short time, often hindered by an average of 1 units each twenty turns even with an unlimited supply of gold, they -are- giants. Many of Jotnar units are a little stronger then their normal counterparts, they ignore terrain and can often cross even mountains that allow them to attack from unexpected directions. They also do not need bring siege-machines, because each giant in himself can tear down a wall or two. Even the Jotnar Workers can bombard cities. For the devious one, Jotnar have the Hill Giants, whom can be mass produced with Hidden Nationality, often making it hard for even other players to determine if they are your units or are the real thing.</Italian>
		<Spanish>Jotnar are the giant kin, an assortment of races that is held together by a common ancestry and traditions. They live centred around small family groups called 'Steaddings' or 'Homestaeds', not seldom attracting some odd kin to their dwellings. Hill giants, Trolls, Fiery giants, Tritons of the sea .. even the mightiest of them - the Titans - might fall in under their banners once they unraveled the mystery of immortality. Tightly held together, slow to bear offspring and to come to action, their pure size make them a force to be considered.[NEWLINE]STRATEGY: Cities are able to work the 3rd plot ring instead of just the first 2. This greatly influence the placement of cities. The Civic 'Traditions' aid in this by reducing the maintnance cost for number of cities.

        <English>The Mazatl are part of the lizardman race that has existed since the Age of Dragons. They spent much of the Age of Magic separated from the rest of Erebus, deep in the jungles and swampland that proved inhospitable to other races, but allowed the lizardmen to thrive in their pyramid-cities.. As the Age of Ice dawned, the jungles were all but destroyed and the swampland froze. Many of the lizardmen died in a panicked exodus to try to escape the bitter cold - their reliance on warm climates meant that they were especially scarred by Mulcarn's entry into creation. The group that would later become the Mazatl took refuge in caves near an inactive volcano, where the heat from the molten earth itself kept them alive. As the Age of Ice passed, the lizards returned to the surface and rebuilt their civilization in the jungle. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Whilst the old civilization worshipped a whole pantheon of gods however, the reborn Mazatl civilization were more focused. They were eternally grateful to Kalshekk - their god of Earth - for protecting them during the Age of Ice, but the followers of Omorr - their god of foresight and learning - gained significant attention when their seers foretold that the world had not been saved from the influences of the Godswar. The icy reign of Mulcarn had been broken, but a time of Fire and Shadow lay ahead, in which the world would suffer the power of Agares himself. The Mazatl have chosen to stand against this fate and seek to avert Armageddon.</English>

Released from the Second Vault, the so-called "Bottomless Tomb," the Scions promise to restore the glory of Patria:  They will drive out the jealous warring angels and set humankind as the rulers of Erebus.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Scions have already conquered disease, infirmity, and even death.  Or perhaps they have been conquered by death.  What they are, exactly, is disputed even among the wise.  They do not seem to be the mindless horrors one expects of the undead.  But in a world of magic seeming often means very little.  That those living in the harsh Age of Rebirth find the promises seductive is, however, all too clear.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Risen Emperor intends to rule all Erebus.  What sort of detente he will accept, if any, is unknown.[PARAGRAPH:1]Within Scion cities the overwhelming majority are the dead, and most are set on enjoying the Emperor's Gift to the fullest.  Treasures of the Age of Rebirth flow into the Scion cities to feed the appetites and desires of a people intent on eternal lives of ease and luxury.[PARAGRAPH:1]Where most Scions take pride in the comeliness of their unageing and unblighted flesh the Scions' military takes full advantage of its malleability.  As a rule Scions are very handsome, at least, possessing the look of perfect health.  But the soldiers of Patria Reborn are terrifying.  Skull-like visages, headless spearmen, and bodies of perfect darkness clothed in bright armor are among the horrors her enemies must face.[PARAGRAPH:1]While the Emperor rules directly the Scions will worship no other God.  Extreme displays of sacrifice and devotion are not uncommon outcomes of exposure to the Emperor's presense.  Many Martyrs of Patria, for example, were once his personal attendents.  The semi-official Apparat of the Imperial Cult is easily equal in size to that of the Church of the Gift.  Within every city of Patria Reborn the quest for eternal pleasure, the call of eternal devotion, and the threat of eternal existance compete for the soul and mind of each Scion.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Undead?" It's a word fraught with traps laid by your Hierarchs, good sir. Look about you, believe your own eyes. Is not this, the city of Scions, cleaner and stronger than your own? Our magics, our knowledge, that of Patria reborn, gives us buildings of gilt marble and metals where you have wood and base granite. To be one of us you need only give up your desperate animal hungers, your diseases, your fear of death. You have heard the tales, and they are all true. Our needs are few, our flesh imperishable, our devices varied and potent. Join us and your life, excuse me, your eternal existence, will be one of ease and delight."

Your calls to Junil, you have now seen, are fruitless.  That old man, if he ever cared - if he ever existed - cannot help you.  Of us... you have heard the tales and they are true.
