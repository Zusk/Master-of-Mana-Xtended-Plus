When first entered Erebus, Condatis can build a Shrine to Danalin. While the Shrine does not offer much benefit in itself, the Shrine gives happiness for all Temple of Remembrances in your realm.</English>

        <English>Terror-that-lurks-beneath, that is what the Cultists called it. The monster. It seems insubstantial, weak as a babe in physical sense. But the horrible nightmares that it command... I shudder to remember the day when me and my party stood facing it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]None of us were able to move. Not even Dachias, the Paladin. Nor Azaniel, Seraph of the Mercurians. Even Selia's blessings and holy chants were unable to protect our mind from the invading tentacles of unholy thoughts.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I did not remember exactly what had happened. It was too horrible for my mind to memorize clearly. All of my nightmares were present, feasting on every little glimmers of my soul. But even in the deepest nightmare, I can still see the others. Each in their own nightmare, each experiencing terrible agony. And that made my nightmare even more horrifying, knowing that nobody will come to rescue me.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The torture were last for eternity; or maybe just a few minutes. All of sudden, the monster lifted its curses from us. With terrible sound ripped from the deepest abyss, the monster suddenly shook and ran amok. This gave us the opportunity to regroup, and launched magical-divine attacks which evaporated the monster.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After we vanquished the monster, Dachias looked at me, wanting an explanation. "What was happened? Why did it lift the curses from us?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I shook my head, unable to answer his question.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Selia was the one who break our stunned silence. "Terrible it was, the monster was nothing more than nightmare. Even the strongest nightmare will perish, when the dreamer awaken, and dispel it from the thought."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Excerpt from the Vanquishing Terror, by Amirahad, High Sage of Cahir Abbey</English>
