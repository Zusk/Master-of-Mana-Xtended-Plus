        <English>The birdsong was so very sweet.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Akris lay on his back listening to the birds listening to the birds and enjoying the warm sunlight on his face. It was a perfect summer day again. The sweet fragrance of wildflowers permeated the air and he inhaled deeply feeling content. Most of his time was spent on this meadow. He just loved the song of the larks that were nesting nearby and there were enough ripe pears and apples on the trees and enough sweet berries on the bushes so that he never had to go hungry. He loved the meadow, he felt at peace here. And the uneasiness that sometimes overcame him when he went wandering always left him here. But it never stayed away for long.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Time passed, he had given up counting the days. He stood in front of the pool again. He did not like the pool, but he liked the water Nymph that made the pool her home. He liked to chat and flirt with the Nymph but she was nowhere to be seen. So he knelt down to drink some of the clear water and there he was again. He remembered now why he did not like the pool. It was home to the gaunt man too. And he also remembered that he always forgot about the gaunt man as soon as he left the pool. From the surface of the pool as yet undisturbed by his hands a skeletal face looked up at him. The mans gums were bloody and his ears and nose were black with frostbite. His hair and beard were coated with ice and snow and he wore the ragged remains of a uniform that seemed vaguely familiar to Akris.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You have to go back Akris!" The voice seemed to come from far away although the gaunt face was very close. Akris´thoughts were in turmoil and he asked confused. "Go back to where? I have always been here. How can I go back to somewhere I have never been?" "You have only been here a few weeks Akris. You have to leave soon or it will be too late!" Akris called out frustrated, the uneasiness had returned in force. "It is always to late with you! Too late for what?" His voice seemed make the water ripple and strangely enough the landscape surrounding the pool seemed to shake too. "If you don´t go back now it will be to late for you. Leave now or you will forget again and I do not have the strength to reach you again." Akris shook his head confused. "Who are you? How do I know I can trust you? And how do I leave?" A gust of wind made the surface of the pool ripple and the gaunt face disappeared. From far away Akris heard him calling. "Just walk! Run! Run for your life!" Akris shook his head to clear it and resolved to leave, but first he would eat to strenghten himself for the journey. And he forgot...[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Akris awoke confused and in pain. He lay in a bed in a small room with clean white plastered walls and the symbol of Junil over the door. He felt very weak and his whole body seemed to be bandaged. While he was still trying to get his bearings the door opened and a young cleric entered. The cleric seemed surprised to see Akris awake but he smiled at him. "Junil is good. Welcome back to the living captain Akris." Akris found it hard to form words they came out sibilant and somehow misformed. "Where am I? How did I get here?" The clerics smile became sad. "This is the field hospital of the order of the flaming heart captain. As for how you got here... You got lost during the assault on Crom Dubhs gardens. That was five months ago. We won the battle but more than five hundred men disappeared into fairy glamours during the battle. Two weeks ago confessor Silvanus managed to dispell one of those glamours. You were found eating snow and chunks of ice, babbling about birdsong. You and three other survivors were brought back here..." The cleric went silent to give Akris time to absorb this news. Akris broke the silence. "How bad is it father?" The cleric shrugged apologetically: " You had already lost most of your teeth and there was nothing we could do to save your nose and ears from frostbite. You also lost some toes and three fingers of your right hand, they were to far gone even for our healing powers... But you will live. And with some rest you will soon be able to walk again."</English>

        <English>Looking out across the frozen wastes he saw the delegation of five mortals carefully making their way towards him. Unlike the southerners the prancing fools of the summer court were so fond of, these five men understood winter and the ancient but ever changing ways of hunter and prey. The wind was blissfully cold and small shards of ice and snowflakes flew with the squalls. While he himself loved such weather, yes reveled in it, most mortals would be cowering and shivering in minutes if asked to go outside in weather like this. Not so these five. They were wary and cautious but that was only wise when dealing with a lord of the Sidhe, any lord but especially him, but the cold and the wind held no terrors for them. They were accustomed to winter and proud of their ability to thrive where others could not.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]They stopped fifty yards in front of him and their leader raised his voice so that he could be heard in spite of the howling of the wind. "We come here at the command of Auric Ulvin the living god of winter to parley with you fairy lord!" At the word fairy a particularly strong and cold gust of wind made even these five shiver nonetheless their speaker continued bravely. "We request your word that we will return to our camp safely if our negotiations are to continue." The answer came in a voice that sounded cold and made those who heard him shiver. It was a voice of power. "You have my word envoys of the mortal god that I will do everything in my power to keep you from harm until I have seen you safely back to your camp." They were plainly nervous for they knew no lord of the Sidhe liked to be bound by his word and he had given in much too easily. But they could find no fault in his words. So after a hurried whispered conference they stepped closer and the negotiations for the surrender of the Illian nation began.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]They haggled for hours but could not reach a compromise they could agree on. The Illians simply refused to become a vassal to the winter court and the Sidhe lord would not accept a peace treaty on any other terms. Finally the lord rose and said: "It seems we will not reach a conclusion here, even if we were to keep on haggling until the coming of the spring. So let me escort you back to your camp so that I might see my obligation fulfilled." The envoys agreed reluctantly and they all started back together towards the Illian camp.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]They reached the camp without incident and there at the gates the lord took his leave of the delegation. "I think you will agree that I discharged my obligations? We concluded our talks and I saw you safely back to your camp." "Indeed, my lord has been very gracious. We regret that we could not come to a satisfactory conclusion."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As Cairn walked away from the camp he whispered into the wind. "You regret you say? No, you do not. At least not yet." Behind him screams could be heard as the fetches that had lain in the snowdrifts in and around the camp began to stir and to kill. "Now I am sure you do." This had been the third delegation to get lost in the winter storms. Perhaps the fourth would be more reasonable.</English>

Unlike the southerners the prancing fools of the summer court were so fond of, these five men understood winter and the ancient but ever changing ways of hunter and prey. The wind was blissfully cold and small shards of ice and snowflakes flew with the squalls. While he himself loved such weather, yes reveled in it, most mortals would be cowering and shivering in minutes if asked to go outside in weather like this. Not so these five. They were wary and cautious but that was only wise when dealing with a lord of the Sidhe, any lord but especially him, but the cold and the wind held no terrors for them. They were accustomed to winter and proud of their ability to thrive where others could not.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]They stopped fifty yards in front of him and their leader raised his voice so that he could be heard in spite of the howling of the wind. "We come here at the command of Auric Ulvin the living god of winter to parley with you fairy lord!" At the word fairy a particularly strong and cold gust of wind made even these five shiver nonetheless their speaker continued bravely. "We request your word that we will return to our camp safely if our negotiations are to continue." The answer came in a voice that sounded cold and made those who heard him shiver. It was a voice of power. "You have my word envoys of the mortal god that I will do everything in my power to keep you from harm until I have seen you safely back to your camp." They were plainly nervous for they knew no lord of the Sidhe liked to be bound by his word and he had given in much too easily. But they could find no fault in his words. So after a hurried whispered conference they stepped closer and the negotiations for the surrender of the Illian nation began.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]They haggled for hours but could not reach a compromise they could agree on. The Illians simply refused to become a vassal to the winter court and the Sidhe lord would not accept a peace treaty on any other terms. Finally the lord rose and said: "It seems we will not reach a conclusion here, even if we were to keep on haggling until the coming of the spring. So let me escort you back to your camp so that I might see my obligation fulfilled." The envoys agreed reluctantly and they all started back together towards the Illian camp.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]They reached the camp without incident and there at the gates the lord took his leave of the delegation. "I think you will agree that I discharged my obligations? We concluded our talks and I saw you safely back to your camp." "Indeed, my lord has been very gracious. We regret that we could not come to a satisfactory conclusion."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As Cairn walked away from the camp he whispered into the wind. "You regret you say? No, you do not. At least not yet." Behind him screams could be heard as the fetches that had lain in the snowdrifts in and around the camp began to stir and to kill. "Now I am sure you do." This had been the third delegation to get lost in the winter storms. Perhaps the fourth would be more reasonable.</Spanish>

        <English>Life was good for the settlers. While the nearby nomads had warned them against settling near the fae woods, there had been no incident at all. No fae magics, no foul tricks. If any, the settlers found the land extremely bountiful. The trees seemed to grow endless fruits. The wild game kept on appearing even after the hunters exhausted their arrows. The water was very refreshing and delicious. Everything was to their taste and more.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After a few weeks, the settlers sent a group of merchant to trade with the nomads. The journey was taxing. Somehow, it took them longer than their first journey to the nomad's camp. Thinking that this must be because the nomad had moved their camp, the merchants kept on going, even though they felt tired already. Unfortunately, their hard work was in vain. By the afternoon of their third day, they had found the nomad's camp. Strangely, this new site looked just like the old one.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Greetings, stranger!" One of nomads came forward and met them. However, he looked concerned and little bit of wary.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Greetings, Thalin." One of the merchants replied. "While we have met only once before, we have shared waters and shade. I don't think we are strangers, according to your custom."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Thalin frowned. "But surely, we have never met before."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The merchants looked at each other dumbfounded. Finally, their leader explained. "I am Amarus. My friends and I are part of settler group settling near the fae woods. We visited your camp about a month ago. We traded a lot, surely you would remember us?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A recognition flashed through Thalin's face but swiftly replaced by horror. Thalin gestured forward and threw something on the earth between them and suddenly roots burst through the earth and entangled the merchants.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Even though he was surprised by this unexpected display of druidic magic, Amarus did not struggle at all. He tried to calm himself and reason with Thalin. He knew that Thalin and his nomads were peaceful and friendly.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Thalin, my friend, I don't think we had done something terrible to earn this kind of welcome?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A group of adult nomads started surrounding them. Some bore their weapons while others preparing amulets and charms. Thalin gestured and several men moved forward, cautiously approaching the merchants. Then, they bled the merchants' hands with pricks of daggers. Blood trickled out, red and fresh.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Thalin, please." The merchants had started to squirm nervously, some whispering fear to the others. Amarus still tried to reason. "Why are you doing this? We met and traded fairly once and we seek to do that again today. Please, Thalin."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Seeing the red blood and the fact that the merchants were still healthy after being pricked with iron dagger, Thalin shook his head in dismay. "My friend, I am sorry but I can not allow you to enter our camp. You have been marked by the faeries and I would not endanger my tribe by taking their cattles away from them."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Cattle? What cattle?" Amarus looked bewildered. "We are not bringing cattles, only fruits and vegetables from our yard. We also have some craft items with us."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Thalin shook his head again and looked at Amarus in pity. There were murmurs among the nomads surrounding them. "The cattles are you and your fellow settlers. Don't you see that you have grown so fat that I am no longer recognised you? They have fed you well. When the time for their feast has arrived, I am sure they will slaughter you for their feast."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At that, Amarus looked at his body and at his fellow merchants. For the first time after settling near the woods, he came into realisation that they had grown so fat, just like what Thalin had said. The nomads murmured symphatetic words and prayers but that provided no solace to Amarus' heart. He wailed and wailed, suddenly remembering his son and other children of the settlers who had been missing for several days. Once more, Thalin was correct. The faeries had chosen some for their feast.</English>
