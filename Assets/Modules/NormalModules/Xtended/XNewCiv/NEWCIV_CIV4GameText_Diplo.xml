		They had left her.
They had escaped where she had remained. Lost, cold, and alone, Ophelia had seen the bloodshed caused by both man and demon alike, and in this hell, the memories faded together where she could neither separate the demon from the man. Even Donal, the one whom had stayed behind, was as brutal and if not more lethal than the demons that chased her through the wastes.
But neither demon nor man would ever find her. Having been abandoned, Ophelia had abandoned many of the Bannor's fanatical approaches to survival. And it was because of this that for the first time since she had fought alongside Capria as a Secondline-Woman, she had felt the surge of hope that was nonexistent in the place like this. In this hell where she had been abandoned, she had adapted.
"Perhaps you are more like that fool Donal than you care to admit, Ms. Rosenthal." The voice was quick to shatter her mood as she spun around, the blade in her hand chipped and stained with the blood of many. But it pointed at nothing but the dusty winds, no foe whispering in her ear, no beast that warranted her sword through its chest. Her eyes darted to and fro, seeing nothing on the horizon.
Seeing nothing but hearing the sounds of rope tearing, rocks tumbling against one another and the inevitable shattering as her traps had been destroyed by something. The sounds echoed across the broken fields, as Ophelia stood there watching precious hours of her labor be destroyed. As the last rock tumbled down from her makeshift rockslide, she knew that this would go on. That fleeting moment of hope was gone.
It had been replaced by something far more sinister. A cold burning sensation on her soul. Perhaps it was the machinations of countless generations that had pushed her to this edge, or perhaps it was something else. But escape was the only option. Her head filled itself with ideas, plots, theories that she hadn't conceived before. But each idea, each thought, was foreign and malicious.
And it was these ideas that had whispered in her ear the only way out of hell, was to be gated out. The path up Mulcarn's domain was too slow- she needed to be free of this wretched place. The seductive whispers of freedom filled her mind as the wastelands grew smaller to her, each step no longer taking the effort of a hundred and each day spent in the red haze she had been left in grew shorter as she found herself taking an almost macabre ecstasy from breaking each demon not of their strength, but of their will. She relished in the confusion and frustration as the enemy lost her trail, and laughed at their incompetence as she followed the whispering winds of the hells.
Time held no meaning for Ophelia as she slipped from one vault, moving in the shadows and slipping by unnoticed. Demons no longer paid heed to her, mistaking her for another petitioner as she pushed between vaults and into her ultimate goal- the Vault of Cerdiwen. The whispers had told her where to go, how to get there, the sigils and mysteries she would need to decipher and ultimately, the way to navigate the vault. But no whisper, no false hope, no burning desire could prepare her as she slipped into the unmentionable abyss. She saw everything in the maelstrom and webways, secrets that pushed her mind to break and then break again, her perceptions shattered every instant. She perceived Furia's torture from the view of the Balseraph angel, gazed through the eyes of Nemed as he twisted and writhed in excruciating pain under the will of Os-Gabella, and felt Flauros pierce her flesh as Taerry, the poor Calabim girl whom was nothing more than a plaything the aristocrat. But to Ophelia, she was all of these people and had seen everything through their eyes. Their pain, their fears, their sorrows, but also their hopes, their dreams, and the futures that could have been. Ophelia didn't know if this was from the whispers or from Cerdiwen herself preying upon the trespassing Bannor, but she no longer cared as her lungs were filled with cold, crisp air. She was on Erebus again. But she had seen the visions of millions of souls, gazed into the very Avatar of Wrath as he was being formed. Things a mere mortal was never meant to see. And her very being was no longer part of her. Her gaze, where it had once been both frightened but and hopeful was now left sinister and distant. Her voice was controlled and her tone pert and quick, her temper now short but her reactions to be thought out and executed with precision. She was no longer Ophelia Rosenthal, but rather the sum of what she had seen.</English>

Seeing nothing but hearing the sounds of rope tearing, rocks tumbling against one another and the inevitable shattering as her traps had been destroyed by something. The sounds echoed across the broken fields, as Ophelia stood there watching precious hours of her labor be destroyed. As the last rock tumbled down from her makeshift rockslide, she knew that this would go on. That fleeting moment of hope was gone.
It had been replaced by something far more sinister. A cold burning sensation on her soul. Perhaps it was the machinations of countless generations that had pushed her to this edge, or perhaps it was something else. But escape was the only option. Her head filled itself with ideas, plots, theories that she hadn't conceived before. But each idea, each thought, was foreign and malicious.
And it was these ideas that had whispered in her ear the only way out of hell, was to be gated out. The path up Mulcarn's domain was too slow- she needed to be free of this wretched place. The seductive whispers of freedom filled her mind as the wastelands grew smaller to her, each step no longer taking the effort of a hundred and each day spent in the red haze she had been left in grew shorter as she found herself taking an almost macabre ecstasy from breaking each demon not of their strength, but of their will. She relished in the confusion and frustration as the enemy lost her trail, and laughed at their incompetence as she followed the whispering winds of the hells.
Time held no meaning for Ophelia as she slipped from one vault, moving in the shadows and slipping by unnoticed. Demons no longer paid heed to her, mistaking her for another petitioner as she pushed between vaults and into her ultimate goal- the Vault of Cerdiwen. The whispers had told her where to go, how to get there, the sigils and mysteries she would need to decipher and ultimately, the way to navigate the vault. But no whisper, no false hope, no burning desire could prepare her as she slipped into the unmentionable abyss. She saw everything in the maelstrom and webways, secrets that pushed her mind to break and then break again, her perceptions shattered every instant. She perceived Furia's torture from the view of the Balseraph angel, gazed through the eyes of Nemed as he twisted and writhed in excruciating pain under the will of Os-Gabella, and felt Flauros pierce her flesh as Taerry, the poor Calabim girl whom was nothing more than a plaything the aristocrat. But to Ophelia, she was all of these people and had seen everything through their eyes. Their pain, their fears, their sorrows, but also their hopes, their dreams, and the futures that could have been. Ophelia didn't know if this was from the whispers or from Cerdiwen herself preying upon the trespassing Bannor, but she no longer cared as her lungs were filled with cold, crisp air. She was on Erebus again. But she had seen the visions of millions of souls, gazed into the very Avatar of Wrath as he was being formed. Things a mere mortal was never meant to see. And her very being was no longer part of her. Her gaze, where it had once been both frightened but and hopeful was now left sinister and distant. Her voice was controlled and her tone pert and quick, her temper now short but her reactions to be thought out and executed with precision. She was no longer Ophelia Rosenthal, but rather the sum of what she had seen.</Spanish>
