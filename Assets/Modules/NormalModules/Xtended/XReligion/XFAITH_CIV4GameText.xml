        <English>When the dusk had come, every people in the city was afraid. Sheaim army was already at their gate. Necromancers, pyromancers and various members of Sheaim magical sects were in the army. No one doubted that the Sheaim army were very enthusiastic in entering the city. No one could imagine what kind of horror and slaughter would befall on their beloved city. No, wait, everyone can. Thus the fear, and hopelessness.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The city were manned by strong soldiers, but the Sheaim employed deadly magics. Even the strongest warrior would fall in the face of tremendous magic. And each fallen comrade would be arisen by the necromancers as new enemy. There was no hope, since steel and muscle could not defeat magic and sorcery.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The old Prior could taste the fear. Even when his eyes no longer see, he could feel it tangible in the air. He was old. He was neither warrior or mage. He was not capable of helping his fellow townsmate in the front line. Thus, he did the only thing he can do; he knelt down by the altar, and started to pray.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Unbeknown to him, his act of praying was followed by everyone in the chapel. Women and children, priests and laymen. All who were unable to bear weapon and face the enemy were gathered in the chapel. All felt the despair, the terror. The old prior's act of praying provide them with a purpose. Instead of waiting for the inevitable death, they would face it during prayers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And so, the Sheaim attacked. Their conjurers fired deadly magics. Their summoners called terrible beasts. Their necromancers waited, ready to bind dead bodies under their unholy command. On the defender side, all warriors raised their weapon. The war priests chanted blessings. The medics waited, ready to fight death using all of their skills. All were ready, and yet, the outcome was clear. The Sheaim would win, and the citizens would be massacred.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Or so they thought.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]History of Erebus, Chapter 7 : the Siege of Athel Maraya</English>

        <English>The situation was dire. Naggarond had fallen to Hippus' advaced cavalry. At the same time, Lanun's corsairs were approaching waters near Kwythellar. This was more than bad, since all Kuriotates main armies were too busy fighting the Calabim in the west. There would be no time for the armies to go east, and arrive in time to save Kwythellar.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Seh-Tassehk was furious with herself. The alliance between Hippus and Lanun had been foreseeable, but their involvement in Kuriotates-Calabim war had been not. Her diplomats had been sure, that both Hippus and Lanun were satisfied with bribe provided by Kuriotates government. Alas, the mercenaries and pirates were more greedy than her diplomats had tought![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Your Majesssty." Seh-Tassehk slithered into the throne room. She bowed deeply to the Boy-King of Kuriotates.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Lady," Cardith Lorda acknowledged his diplomatic advisor and motioned her to come forward. "The situation is dire, I believe."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Yesss, Your Majesssty." Seh-Tassehk bowed again. "I am terribly sssorry for my failuresss."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cardith Lorda patted her fingers. An assurance which did nothing to lighten the burden in Seh-Tassehk's heart. "Do not worry, Lady. Not all is lost. We are not alone in this war. I just met an angelic messenger Lady Ethne had sent. She told me that the Elohim were praying for a miracle to lighten our burden. I believe in her, and in our patron. Lugus will not abandon us and let the realm of Kuriotates is swallowed by terrible darkness."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Seh-Tassehk bowed her head. She understood the Boy-King's deep faith in Lugus and the Empyreans. She herself found the faith attractive, and considered to convert sometime in the future. But she could not fathom, what kind of miracle would be able to save them. Not to mention, the Elohim was too far for sending direct reinforcements, angelic or not.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The enemies were approaching. Lanun's corsairs were visible in the coastline. Seh-Tassehk was preparing her fireball spell, when suddenly a bright light erupted in the sky. Cries were heard from the pirate's fleets, but none of Kuriotates' soldiers were hurt by the light.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"That is Lugus' Answer to ours and our ally's prayers." Cardith Lorda solemnly said. "Their sights and movements will be impaired by the searing light. It is our time to launch an attack! Prepare all of your Lamias, Lady. Cast your holy spells and destroy our enemy for good!"</English>

        <English>It started in one city. Just a small cough, a little weakening of bodily functions. No one notice, since at that time, the Bannor empire had been in the holy war against the cursed Sheaim.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It then spread to several more cities. The sickness began to grow. Children and the elders were the primary victims. Some even could not get up from the bed. But, our healers and medics were too consumed by the battlefield.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Finally, it spread to the entire nation. Somehow, the sickness managed to transform itself into lethal killer. Not only common folks were fallen. Nobles, warriors, mages, even priests too became the victims of this plague. All of them died in horrible death, after consumed by terrible pains.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Only after this had become a national disaster, we managed to gain the government's attention. Alas, it had been too late. Too many had died, and many more would follow. The Plague of Rotten Flesh had brought the once-powerful Bannor empire into its demise.</English>
