[BUGS!!!]
- When terraforming, selecting a specific tile makes the spell cost no Faith (happens in FOL's Mystical Forest).
- Using Adaptive: pick Arcane, queue various arcane buildings for no yield cost, then pick another trait. You will still build arcane buildings for free. Or, cancel them to get lots of yield. Solution: 
- Ogres!
- Build city should not require food on the tile?
- Reduce yield and gold from pillage?
