        <English>[H1]Frozen Civilization Concept[\H1][PARAGRAPH:2]The Frozen are a third summonable civilization, added with the Frozen New Civ Mod by TC01. They can be summoned after researching Elementalism and completing the ritual/project "Liberation". This can be done by neutral and evil civilizations.[PARAGRAPH:2]Both the Infernals and Mercurians, the other summonable civilizations, have some system for gaining Angels or Manes. The Frozen's system for gaining "Frozen Souls" (which are more like the Mane then the Angel) involves passing promotions through combat.[PARAGRAPH:1]All Frozen and Illian units have the Winterborn promotion. Units with Winterborn pass the "Wintered" promotion to enemies in combat, much like how the diseased promotions work. This promotion weakens the enemy, passes Wintered to enemies in combat, and when killed, provides the Frozen with Frozen Soul units. Winterborn units that are killed also provide Frozen Souls.[PARAGRAPH:1]Based on this, you could either target the Illians and Doviello, civilizations with Winterborn promotions on all their units. Or, you could target their enemies, who may have units with Wintered. If you aren't gaining many Frozen Souls this way, you can cast your worldspell once you research Sorcery. It is called Wintering, and gives all "alive" (not mechanical or naval) units that do not belong to your team the Wintered promotion. It also spreads ice terrain, "upgrading" all ice terrain inside of your empire.[PARAGRAPH:2]Like the Illians, the Frozen are capable of Ascending their leader, Taranis, to become Taranis Ascended. On completing the Ascension ritual, if their hero Taranis is on the map, he is killed, and replaced by Taranis Ascended. Taranis Ascended is a powerful unit that is basically identical to Auric Ascended, however, the capabilities of the Ascended have been boosted. Currently, both Auric and Taranis Ascended have been given +10 Ice Affinity.[PARAGRAPH:1]Your hero Taranis starts with the Unchanging promotion. This prevents him from being able to attack, but gives him a city defense bonus. He is also immortal (in that he must die twice on the same turn to be killed). Once built, he cannot be rebuilt, however he will reappear in whatever city is your capital. If you want to relocate him, move your capital somewhere else, and if he dies once, he will reappear there.[PARAGRAPH:2]All Frozen cities start with the following buildings: Temple of the Hand (which provides the ice effect), Elder Council, Obsidian Gate, Forge, Mage Guild, and Frozen Souls. Frozen Souls is a marker that replaces the "Demonic Citizens" marker that Infernal cities have.[PARAGRAPH:2](More information will be added here in the future)</English>

        <English>Chapter 1: The Liberation[NEWLINE][LINK=UNIT_TARANIS]Chapter 2: The Liberation[\LINK][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Auric stood in meditation surrounded by vast ice crystals. He smiled as he saw images of legions of Ice Golems engaging Luchuirp Golems and holding them at bay, creating a wall of stasis that stretched across the Luchuirp border, as his allies struck. He shitfted his imaging and saw frostling bandits, supported by flesh constructs from Mokka's Cauldron, engaging the Svartalfar. Things were going well, and it looked as if the Deepening would soon begin, according to Anangtios's report. That was when he sensed a disturbance around him.[PARAGRAPH:1]Reflexes honed while wandering Erebus kicked into action, and he ducked behind one of the crystals. The assassin's dart, tipped with a plant that caused spontaneous combustion when it hit a target, struck and melted a chunk of ice away. He snapped "Slow!" and the will behind the command caused time around the assassin to stretch and slow down as she was about to utter a spell that would blow the throne room apart with an inferno. It had the added effect of causing the assassin's invisibility charm to stop working, causing her to become visible to all.[PARAGRAPH:1]Auric walked forward and studied the assassin. She was an elf, apparently, wrapped in a black cloak covered with invisibility runes that was typical of Svartalfar dress. She also carried a large supply of deadly implements. He waved his hand, and the slow time effects intensified, stopping time around the two of them entirely. Another gesture caused the temperature to lower, subtly. Guards rushed into the room, but to Auric and the elven prisoner, they did not move.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I just thought you should know," he said, "that Illian ice sculpters are capable of altering the position and even the shape of a body after it has been frozen. It produces beautiful artwork." He gestured to the columns of ice statues lining the palace. "Not all were made out of once living people- but some were," he continued. "But, it can be done to a still living body. The process is incredibly painful, as you can no doubt imagine." The assassin's face showed that she did.[PARAGRAPH:1]Auric released frozen time, and the guards seized her. He said ominously, "Sculpt her until she talks." The guards departed, dragging the shrieking prisoner, who seconds later died. He frowned. He thought he had removed all magical items with the slow spell. Evidently there was a physical poison as well.[PARAGRAPH:1]He sighed, shaking his head. He needed better guards. And then an idea, propelled by the essence of Mulcarn that lived within him, came to him, and he shouted an order. A Disciple of Winter rushed in, and he gave instructions to him, and the disciple rushed out to obey them.[PARAGRAPH:2]The tower of ice, not located in Garduk but near Letum Frigus, had been built by Auric's will, and it would stand so long as he remained alive- or willed it to collapse. Ice particles had gathered slowly and formed into beautiful crystals, which then formed into a tower. At the top of the tower were four crystalline spikes resembling stalagmites. It was at this top where Auric, Dumnanios, Riuros, and Anangtios were gathered. He had risen it for this specific purpose.[PARAGRAPH:1]The ritual was well under way. Even if anyone else on Erebus was aware of it, and could fight through the Illian and Doviello guards patrolling the empire, they would not be in time to stop it. Auric's vision honed in on an island in a lake at the edge of Elohim lands. Knowing that it was important, the Elohim were guarding a small crystal sphere on the shores of the lake with their lives. He laughed as he gathered energy. Those lives would not be enough...[PARAGRAPH:2]Arlonte, captain of the guards assigned to protect the Evergreen Lake, sighed as he watched the small company of Elohim assigned to this site. It was a good job they had- they did not have to protect the lake itself but rather what appeared to be a glowing green spherical rock. The priest, Lenyos, assigned to their group was currently studying it. The other guards were also enjoying themselves in the grass. They could relax in the lake, but Einion Logos had warned them strictly- do not venture into the lake.[PARAGRAPH:1]He headed over to the priest to take a look at his analysis of the object. That was when he felt a strange sensation, as if lightning was coming. He looked up, along with the others.[PARAGRAPH:1]There was no lightning. The clouds were glowing pure white, and it seemed as if... they were freezing.[PARAGRAPH:1]Then, there was a sudden blast of blue-white light from the frozen clouds. It appeared to be lightning, but it was clearly not. It was directed straight at the object they were supposed to protect, and one of the guards nearby instinctively dove into the path of the lightning. His body froze and was covered in ice. It then fell to the orb, which flared green, and the body of the guard caught on fire until nothing was left but ashes. Arlonte stood staring at the orb. It was obviously a tool against winter, but...[PARAGRAPH:1]His thoughts were interrupted when another blast shot through the sky. Seconds before it hit, Lenyos, a priest of the Fellowship of Leaves, muttered a prayer, and the earth glowed green. Guardian vines emerged and seized the orb. The blast of ice struck them... and nothing happened.[PARAGRAPH:2]Auric reeled as a powerful presence interrupted his attack on the Orb of Sucellus guarding the lake. He had frozen a human who had been in the way of the blast, he knew, but that second power... intrigued, he studied it. And the part that was Mulcarn gave him the rest of the information. He had tried to freeze a massive creature, the Guardian of the Forest. Somehow, a being he had identified as a priest of leaves had summoned the Guardian's vines to defend the orb. Clever. He had tried to freeze the entire thing. There did not seem to be a way to win.[PARAGRAPH:1]But, after a few minutes thinking, he had one, and resumed his attack, gathering more power...[PARAGRAPH:2]The Elohim captain looked up again. Arlonte prayed that the attacker was beat and would go away. But that, of course, did not happen. Instead, another blast rained down from the frozen clouds. This one, though was glowing faintly golden... Arlonte realized with surprise that it was a lightning blast. The blast continued coming, becoming a solid beam, not a quick blast. Lenyos gasped in horror as the lightning drilled into one of the vines.[PARAGRAPH:1]He cried, "The guardian..." and rushed forward. A deflected ray of lightning struck him. Lenyos screamed in pain and died.[PARAGRAPH:1]That was when the blast penetrated through the vine.[PARAGRAPH:2]Auric mentally roared at the presence of the Guardian, demanding it submit, even as he gathered all the ice energy he had in him, swallowing several nearby blizzards and nearly undoing the tower of ice he was standing on. He hurled it down into the ripped open vine. The ice would either freeze a portion of the great Guardian, or would destroy the Orb of Sucellus.[PARAGRAPH:1]He waited to see what would happen. He did not have enough power to both take on the Guardian and to destroy the Orb simultaneously. Already, he felt himself wilting. He continued to pour out his energy and shout at the Guardian...[PARAGRAPH:2]Arlonte's eyes widened as the vines began to freeze. They crystallized and abruptly melted into nothingness, the Orb having burned the frozen portions away. The remaining vines at the base of the Orb recoiled and reentered the earth, vanishing, as did the aura of nature surrounding the area. His face turned grim as he considered what this meant.[PARAGRAPH:2]The icy beam continued coming, striking the orb, creating a shield of fire around the orb. Ice energy touched and froze the outside of the orb, which caught fire. That fire was then frozen as more ice energy poured down. Eventually, the orb cracked, and exploded, as it could take no more ice magic. Arlonte and the guards ducked as the smoke cleared and the beam stopped.[PARAGRAPH:2]That was when the lake froze. He turned, and his face became pale as he saw an armored warrior stalking across the ice, longsword and shield in hand. Arlonte opened his mouth to order a charge, when he found he could no longer speak. The figure waved a hand and ice filled his mouth. Still striding forward, he swung the sword in a long sweep and Arlonte dropped to the ground. As he died, he saw the figure make short work of the other guards as well...[PARAGRAPH:2]Taranis finished killing the guards and looked around, taking in data. It was another age. Mulcarn's presence was no longer felt- wait... there was an emission of him from the north, from the old realm of the Illians. Analysis: Mulcarn is weakened. Directive: Head north. Directive: Kill all in between targets. Directive: Determine the state of Mulcarn. Directive: Gather aid. Input data: No creatures of ice felt within reasonable range. Analysis: They are dispered or gathered near Mulcarn. Directive: Find them.[PARAGRAPH:1]Such was Taranis. He could take in data and make decisions, albeit in a machine-like method. But after that data was taken in and Taranis came to a decision based on it, it was dumped since it could not be remembered. He continued to reevaluate his current directives, carefully checking if the position of Mulcarn or his ice demons altered. They did not. One final directive was ordered, based on climate data.[PARAGRAPH:1]Directive: Begin the re-wintering of the world.</English>

It had the added effect of causing the assassin's invisibility charm to stop working, causing her to become visible to all.[PARAGRAPH:1]Auric walked forward and studied the assassin. She was an elf, apparently, wrapped in a black cloak covered with invisibility runes that was typical of Svartalfar dress. She also carried a large supply of deadly implements. He waved his hand, and the slow time effects intensified, stopping time around the two of them entirely. Another gesture caused the temperature to lower, subtly. Guards rushed into the room, but to Auric and the elven prisoner, they did not move.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I just thought you should know," he said, "that Illian ice sculpters are capable of altering the position and even the shape of a body after it has been frozen. It produces beautiful artwork." He gestured to the columns of ice statues lining the palace. "Not all were made out of once living people- but some were," he continued. "But, it can be done to a still living body. The process is incredibly painful, as you can no doubt imagine." The assassin's face showed that she did.[PARAGRAPH:1]Auric released frozen time, and the guards seized her. He said ominously, "Sculpt her until she talks." The guards departed, dragging the shrieking prisoner, who seconds later died. He frowned. He thought he had removed all magical items with the slow spell. Evidently there was a physical poison as well.[PARAGRAPH:1]He sighed, shaking his head. He needed better guards. And then an idea, propelled by the essence of Mulcarn that lived within him, came to him, and he shouted an order. A Disciple of Winter rushed in, and he gave instructions to him, and the disciple rushed out to obey them.[PARAGRAPH:2]The tower of ice, not located in Garduk but near Letum Frigus, had been built by Auric's will, and it would stand so long as he remained alive- or willed it to collapse. Ice particles had gathered slowly and formed into beautiful crystals, which then formed into a tower. At the top of the tower were four crystalline spikes resembling stalagmites. It was at this top where Auric, Dumnanios, Riuros, and Anangtios were gathered. He had risen it for this specific purpose.[PARAGRAPH:1]The ritual was well under way. Even if anyone else on Erebus was aware of it, and could fight through the Illian and Doviello guards patrolling the empire, they would not be in time to stop it. Auric's vision honed in on an island in a lake at the edge of Elohim lands. Knowing that it was important, the Elohim were guarding a small crystal sphere on the shores of the lake with their lives. He laughed as he gathered energy. Those lives would not be enough...[PARAGRAPH:2]Arlonte, captain of the guards assigned to protect the Evergreen Lake, sighed as he watched the small company of Elohim assigned to this site. It was a good job they had- they did not have to protect the lake itself but rather what appeared to be a glowing green spherical rock. The priest, Lenyos, assigned to their group was currently studying it. The other guards were also enjoying themselves in the grass. They could relax in the lake, but Einion Logos had warned them strictly- do not venture into the lake.[PARAGRAPH:1]He headed over to the priest to take a look at his analysis of the object. That was when he felt a strange sensation, as if lightning was coming. He looked up, along with the others.[PARAGRAPH:1]There was no lightning. The clouds were glowing pure white, and it seemed as if... they were freezing.[PARAGRAPH:1]Then, there was a sudden blast of blue-white light from the frozen clouds. It appeared to be lightning, but it was clearly not. It was directed straight at the object they were supposed to protect, and one of the guards nearby instinctively dove into the path of the lightning. His body froze and was covered in ice. It then fell to the orb, which flared green, and the body of the guard caught on fire until nothing was left but ashes. Arlonte stood staring at the orb. It was obviously a tool against winter, but...[PARAGRAPH:1]His thoughts were interrupted when another blast shot through the sky. Seconds before it hit, Lenyos, a priest of the Fellowship of Leaves, muttered a prayer, and the earth glowed green. Guardian vines emerged and seized the orb. The blast of ice struck them... and nothing happened.[PARAGRAPH:2]Auric reeled as a powerful presence interrupted his attack on the Orb of Sucellus guarding the lake. He had frozen a human who had been in the way of the blast, he knew, but that second power... intrigued, he studied it. And the part that was Mulcarn gave him the rest of the information. He had tried to freeze a massive creature, the Guardian of the Forest. Somehow, a being he had identified as a priest of leaves had summoned the Guardian's vines to defend the orb. Clever. He had tried to freeze the entire thing. There did not seem to be a way to win.[PARAGRAPH:1]But, after a few minutes thinking, he had one, and resumed his attack, gathering more power...[PARAGRAPH:2]The Elohim captain looked up again. Arlonte prayed that the attacker was beat and would go away. But that, of course, did not happen. Instead, another blast rained down from the frozen clouds. This one, though was glowing faintly golden... Arlonte realized with surprise that it was a lightning blast. The blast continued coming, becoming a solid beam, not a quick blast. Lenyos gasped in horror as the lightning drilled into one of the vines.[PARAGRAPH:1]He cried, "The guardian..." and rushed forward. A deflected ray of lightning struck him. Lenyos screamed in pain and died.[PARAGRAPH:1]That was when the blast penetrated through the vine.[PARAGRAPH:2]Auric mentally roared at the presence of the Guardian, demanding it submit, even as he gathered all the ice energy he had in him, swallowing several nearby blizzards and nearly undoing the tower of ice he was standing on. He hurled it down into the ripped open vine. The ice would either freeze a portion of the great Guardian, or would destroy the Orb of Sucellus.[PARAGRAPH:1]He waited to see what would happen. He did not have enough power to both take on the Guardian and to destroy the Orb simultaneously. Already, he felt himself wilting. He continued to pour out his energy and shout at the Guardian...[PARAGRAPH:2]Arlonte's eyes widened as the vines began to freeze. They crystallized and abruptly melted into nothingness, the Orb having burned the frozen portions away. The remaining vines at the base of the Orb recoiled and reentered the earth, vanishing, as did the aura of nature surrounding the area. His face turned grim as he considered what this meant.[PARAGRAPH:2]The icy beam continued coming, striking the orb, creating a shield of fire around the orb. Ice energy touched and froze the outside of the orb, which caught fire. That fire was then frozen as more ice energy poured down. Eventually, the orb cracked, and exploded, as it could take no more ice magic. Arlonte and the guards ducked as the smoke cleared and the beam stopped.[PARAGRAPH:2]That was when the lake froze. He turned, and his face became pale as he saw an armored warrior stalking across the ice, longsword and shield in hand. Arlonte opened his mouth to order a charge, when he found he could no longer speak. The figure waved a hand and ice filled his mouth. Still striding forward, he swung the sword in a long sweep and Arlonte dropped to the ground. As he died, he saw the figure make short work of the other guards as well...[PARAGRAPH:2]Taranis finished killing the guards and looked around, taking in data. It was another age. Mulcarn's presence was no longer felt- wait... there was an emission of him from the north, from the old realm of the Illians. Analysis: Mulcarn is weakened. Directive: Head north. Directive: Kill all in between targets. Directive: Determine the state of Mulcarn. Directive: Gather aid. Input data: No creatures of ice felt within reasonable range. Analysis: They are dispered or gathered near Mulcarn. Directive: Find them.[PARAGRAPH:1]Such was Taranis. He could take in data and make decisions, albeit in a machine-like method. But after that data was taken in and Taranis came to a decision based on it, it was dumped since it could not be remembered. He continued to reevaluate his current directives, carefully checking if the position of Mulcarn or his ice demons altered. They did not. One final directive was ordered, based on climate data.[PARAGRAPH:1]Directive: Begin the re-wintering of the world.</French>
		<German>Chapter 1: The Liberation[NEWLINE][LINK=UNIT_TARANIS]Chapter 2: The Liberation[\LINK][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Auric stood in meditation surrounded by vast ice crystals. He smiled as he saw images of legions of Ice Golems engaging Luchuirp Golems and holding them at bay, creating a wall of stasis that stretched across the Luchuirp border, as his allies struck. He shitfted his imaging and saw frostling bandits, supported by flesh constructs from Mokka's Cauldron, engaging the Svartalfar.

He had tried to freeze the entire thing. There did not seem to be a way to win.[PARAGRAPH:1]But, after a few minutes thinking, he had one, and resumed his attack, gathering more power...[PARAGRAPH:2]The Elohim captain looked up again. Arlonte prayed that the attacker was beat and would go away. But that, of course, did not happen. Instead, another blast rained down from the frozen clouds. This one, though was glowing faintly golden... Arlonte realized with surprise that it was a lightning blast. The blast continued coming, becoming a solid beam, not a quick blast. Lenyos gasped in horror as the lightning drilled into one of the vines.[PARAGRAPH:1]He cried, "The guardian..." and rushed forward. A deflected ray of lightning struck him. Lenyos screamed in pain and died.[PARAGRAPH:1]That was when the blast penetrated through the vine.[PARAGRAPH:2]Auric mentally roared at the presence of the Guardian, demanding it submit, even as he gathered all the ice energy he had in him, swallowing several nearby blizzards and nearly undoing the tower of ice he was standing on. He hurled it down into the ripped open vine. The ice would either freeze a portion of the great Guardian, or would destroy the Orb of Sucellus.[PARAGRAPH:1]He waited to see what would happen. He did not have enough power to both take on the Guardian and to destroy the Orb simultaneously. Already, he felt himself wilting. He continued to pour out his energy and shout at the Guardian...[PARAGRAPH:2]Arlonte's eyes widened as the vines began to freeze. They crystallized and abruptly melted into nothingness, the Orb having burned the frozen portions away. The remaining vines at the base of the Orb recoiled and reentered the earth, vanishing, as did the aura of nature surrounding the area. His face turned grim as he considered what this meant.[PARAGRAPH:2]The icy beam continued coming, striking the orb, creating a shield of fire around the orb. Ice energy touched and froze the outside of the orb, which caught fire. That fire was then frozen as more ice energy poured down. Eventually, the orb cracked, and exploded, as it could take no more ice magic. Arlonte and the guards ducked as the smoke cleared and the beam stopped.[PARAGRAPH:2]That was when the lake froze. He turned, and his face became pale as he saw an armored warrior stalking across the ice, longsword and shield in hand. Arlonte opened his mouth to order a charge, when he found he could no longer speak. The figure waved a hand and ice filled his mouth. Still striding forward, he swung the sword in a long sweep and Arlonte dropped to the ground. As he died, he saw the figure make short work of the other guards as well...[PARAGRAPH:2]Taranis finished killing the guards and looked around, taking in data. It was another age. Mulcarn's presence was no longer felt- wait... there was an emission of him from the north, from the old realm of the Illians. Analysis: Mulcarn is weakened. Directive: Head north. Directive: Kill all in between targets. Directive: Determine the state of Mulcarn. Directive: Gather aid. Input data: No creatures of ice felt within reasonable range. Analysis: They are dispered or gathered near Mulcarn. Directive: Find them.[PARAGRAPH:1]Such was Taranis. He could take in data and make decisions, albeit in a machine-like method. But after that data was taken in and Taranis came to a decision based on it, it was dumped since it could not be remembered. He continued to reevaluate his current directives, carefully checking if the position of Mulcarn or his ice demons altered. They did not. One final directive was ordered, based on climate data.[PARAGRAPH:1]Directive: Begin the re-wintering of the world.</Spanish>

In the Age of Rebirth, people talk fearfully of the Infernal menance (or, depending on your viewpoint, the Mercurian menance). But the Frozen made the Infernals look like amateurs.[PARAGRAPH:1]Mulcarn ruled a vast amount of forces. Many were fashioned directly, such as his court of frozen statues or the columns of Frost Giants. But the Frostlings served as the meat of the Frozen legion in its march on Erebus.

Their commander Taranis was trapped by Sucellus in battle, and Mulcarn was slain by Kylorin. With the vanish of their god's power, the Frozen withered. They fled to Mulcarn's realm, or dispersed and sought out the tundras of Erebus.[PARAGRAPH:1]Yet, they were not gone for good. During the Era of Ascendency, when the Illians attempted to ascend Auric Ulvin, a number of Spells of Winter they casted gave back strength to the Frozen forces. A final spell called Taranis back from his island prison- along with a countless legion of frostlings and other beasts.[PARAGRAPH:1]Taranis had but one goal, and that was to reclaim the world.

Analysis: border fort. Accessing climatological data. Temperatures in and beyond this fort are significantly colder then those here. Conclusion: Mulcarn is nearby.[PARAGRAPH:1]After performing this analysis, Taranis continued his steady pace forward. He raised a hand and accessed ice magic. Nothing happened for a few minutes, until the frozen walls of the Illian border fort reshaped themselves into an open gate. Startled, Illian defenders rushed forward to intercept this stranger. Taranis charged them, a sword stroke killing one, and a blast of ice magic freezing the rest.[PARAGRAPH:1]To an outsider it appeared that someone, perhaps Frostlings, had constructed a beautiful replica of an Illian fortress and it's men out of ice crystals. The truth was that it was one of many that Taranis had created from different nations during his trek to Garduk.[PARAGRAPH:2]Dunmanios, senior of the Priests of Winter and High Priest of Winter of the White Hand, rode across the barren tundra on the back of an icehorse. The Illian icehorses were bred from the ancient Winter Horses created by Mulcarn, just as he had created the Winter Wolves from the Doviello wolves. Because of Dumnanios's seniority, he had been given one of these rare, prized creatures (who could run faster in the snow then on land) and ordered to warn anything between the frozen fort and Garduk not to interfere with Taranis, the assumption being he would be the most capable to stop Taranis.[PARAGRAPH:1]He spotted the small town of Suspiro, reasonably close to Garduk. With it's position near several key herds of arctic deer it was rapidly becoming more then just a small town and one of the main centers for the arctic deer hunt and trade. Unfortunately, it looked like there was nothing going on today- a bad sign.[PARAGRAPH:1]The priest of winter muttered a prayer to Auric under his breath and felt the strength of the reborn god of winter fill him. He urged on the icehorse, which responded to the blast of ice magic and charged before, arriving at the city instantly.[PARAGRAPH:1]By the looks of it, Taranis had just been here previously. He had carved a frozen path of destruction through Suspiro, freezing many buildings, people, and arctic deer being stored in icehouses. And the parts of Suspiro that had not been frozen were in panic. There was rioting, and the Illian defenders and police were having a hard time maintaining order. He cursed, and wondered if Taranis was really worth all of the destruction and chaos he was causing.[PARAGRAPH:2]Auric Ulvin rose from his throne as there was an explosion, and then total silence, in the chambers outside of the audience hall. The Illian guards, the members of his court (who were best called syncophants), and other officials around him startled and stepped aside in fear. Auric raised an eyebrow as the doors exploded, and then froze in mid-air before dropping to the ground and shattering.[PARAGRAPH:1]From the clouds of dust, Taranis the Unchanging stepped forward, his ancient longsword and shield in hand. He towered over the Illians by a head, and was covered from head to toe in armor. His blue eyes of crystal ice looked around the room before locking on Auric. He marched forward slowly.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Illian guards, once realizing that this... thing... was heading towards their god-king, overcame their fear and threw themselves in his path. Auric opened his mouth to warn them away, but he was too late as Taranis swung his sword. The instant touch of the blade caused the guard who was touched to freeze. Taranis waved his hand and the frozen guards shattered, and he stepped over what was left of them.[PARAGRAPH:1]Taranis halted in front of Auric, waiting for... something. Auric wondered what it was. He had no way of communicating with Taranis to discover it, and Taranis would not answer him. Except... that was not entirely true. He entered Taranis's mind, and was instantly struck by how alien it was. It was like that of a golem.[PARAGRAPH:1]Except... it wasn't. Golems were artificial and had no mind, at least as how the term was understood. But Taranis had a mind. Much of it had been written over, it seemed, by the complex writing of Mulcarn's blessing. Mulcarn had sealed off huge portions of Taranis's mind. Auric nearly became lost in wonder in trying to understand this work of his predecessor. However, he remembered his task, and sought to find a method to speak to Taranis.[PARAGRAPH:1]There would presumably be some way for him to give Taranis and instruction. He found what appeared to be the correct way to send a command, and sent a mental ping it to it. He received another mental ping in return, this one from Taranis. Auric smiled slightly.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I am Auric Ulvin, the soon-to-be-new god of winter, and I demand you acknowledge me as your lord," sent Auric. Taranis's mind leaped into action and his body started slightly. Auric felt Taranis processing information.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Prove your identity," was all that Auric was able to parse from the mental reply. Auric looked through himself for the essence of Mulcarn and the power of the sphere of winter, and showed it to Taranis, who jerked slightly again. Auric wondered what these jerks might mean, but had no time to fully analyze Taranis's mind. He still wasn't sure he was doing this correctly.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Confirmed. Instruction?" Taranis sent through the mental channel. Auric hesitated. How to best phrase this, he wondered.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Guard me, the reborn god of winter. Do not allow anyone or anything to harm me. Accompany me at all times unless I order you not to." ordered Auric. Taranis nodded and acknowledged the order. Satisfied, Auric broke from the mental contact and sat down on his throne of ice.[PARAGRAPH:1]Taranis walked up the steps to the throne and adopted a position behind Auric's throne. Anyone or anything intending to harm him would have to get through an unchanging, undying, archangel of winter. It seemed like he had given the instruction the right way after all.

After a brief resurgance during the Age of Ice they are now scattered and infrequent outside of Mulcarn's hell.[PARAGRAPH:2]From the Bestiary of Erebus, by Kael[PARAGRAPH:2]Dagda reprimanded the other gods. "Why do you pursue these selfish projects? There is no order in what you do." It was the time before Man and his kin. The twenty-one servants were new in their powers, and exulted in the heady joy of unbridled creation. Little thought was given to the consequences of many of their endeavors, and entire worlds were often shaped by one god alone. Dagda alone forbore utilizing his power, observing the others. At the grey lord's words, the others turned, from the corners of temperance, to listen to his plan. Worlds should be made in which no aspect was expressed over any other so that in harmony something unique could be formed. Creatures in balance might express the supreme gift that they themselves had been given - free will. The wisdom of his words was clear, and a multitude of such worlds were made, where neither ice nor fire was ascendant, where light and darkness took their turns, and where faith and foresight together illuminated the minds of the mortals. Thus were worlds pleasing to the One formed. [PARAGRAPH:1]Many gods, in their deepest souls, resented their reprimand from Dagda, despite its wisdom. Mulcarn was one such. Frost Giants had been created by his hand alone. They did not obey the laws of Cernunnos or of Bhall. They had no need of mind nor spirit, and they bowed to him alone. But no place was found for these glaciers on legs in the orderly creation. They languished on worlds of ice in the dimensions of folly, which saw little of the gods after the mortal races came to prominence. [PARAGRAPH:1]So one of Mulcarn's joys upon enthroning himself on Erebus was bringing his ancient Frost Giants to his side. They need not eat, and they cannot reproduce. The barest glint of sentience has awakened in them now that they are again in their Father's presence. His thoughts are their thoughts, and their glassy eyes are his eyes as well. They wander the endless tundra, proof that since Mulcarn needed no help in creation, he needs none in sovereignty either.</English>

Their knowledge of ice magic makes them very useful as ice druids.[PARAGRAPH:2]From Chapter 8, Volume I of The Elves of Mulcarn, by Sidar Historian Jevhan</Spanish>

They were patrolled by Aquilan from the skies, but not guarded unduly for the whole purpose of the realm was to force manes into the swamp and into Mammon's city.[PARAGRAPH:1]However, when Mulcarn abandoned his realm, there was no one left to guard the souls, for his demonic legion was scattered throughout Erebus, and countless more were still coming through. Demon lords sent hunters and scavengers to see if any were useful and bring them to their masters' realms or onto Erebus.[PARAGRAPH:1]In particular, Ceridwen commanded her Demons of Magic to gather hundreds of the souls together and forge them into Tar Demons. She then sent these strange forged souls to aid the Sheaim and others devoted to her in the Age of Rebirth.[PARAGRAPH:1]When Taranis was Liberated, he chose to continue fighting on Erebus, to try and return it to the Age of Ice- to fulfill the element of Stasis- rather than return to his realm. But he was also charged to defend his master's realm in his absence.[PARAGRAPH:1]To save the souls that were 'rightfully his' (as the archangel of and soon-to-be-Ascended God of Winter), he built portals, icy conduits that pulled countless numbers out of Mulyr and into the cities of the Frozen Legion. There, they formed into 'swamp ghettos', laboring for the benefit of the Frozen. But the swamps significantly weakened the health of the city, even the undead demonic legions were affected by their presence, for it disturbed the pristine nature of Stasis.[PARAGRAPH:2]From Chapter 7, Volume IV of Cryo-Demonology, by Sidar Historian Aritar.</English>
