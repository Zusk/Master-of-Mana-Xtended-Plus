        <English>Hianthrogh stood upon the highest level of the temple-palace and looked to the burning horizon. The Sheaim approached Nochtli in force. Barbaric warriors, priests of dark power and otherworldly creatures filled their ranks. Within hours they would breach the wall of jungle and be upon the Mazatl capital. Smoke filled the air, as the sense of despair filled the hearts of the Mazatl. Below him, the warriors of Nochtli prepared a desperate defence. They could not hope to stand for long, but they would stand for as long as they could.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The shards of Coatlann - one of their most important symbols - had been transported away to another city. Preparations were being made for a second stand there, but there was no time. Unless Nochtli could stand, the Sheaim would sweep through the Mazatl empire. There was little chance to defend the city however, as the Sheaim had constructed great machines of war and wielded magic that could strike down their defenders whilst they stood upon the tall walls.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]No, the enemy knew how to destroy cities well enough. Nochtli could not be defended. If defense is not possible and retreat unthinkable, the only recourse is... [PARAGRAPH]"We shall attack them as they approach" stated Hianthrogh to the temple-guards closest to him. "Carry my words to the warriors, abandon the defense preparations, set scouts upon the trails and prepare to ambush the Sheaim forces as they approach. We shall fight them in the burning jungle and they shall know of our resolve."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Few of Hianthrogh's warriors survived that day. The jungle and the city of Nochtli burned for days afterwards, but the toll exacted upon the Sheaim gave Tebryn Arbandi reason to pause. He had conquered a city stuck amongst deep swamp and charred jungle, which provided him little benefit. In exchange he had expended a large portion of his southern forces. His forces already depleted, he could expect the next assault against the lizards to be even more costly. The cost outweighed the benefit - for now, the lizards could keep their swamp. There were greater foes that were easier to topple.</English>

        <English>The Mazatl are part of the lizardman race that has existed since the Age of Dragons. They spent much of the Age of Magic separated from the rest of Erebus, deep in the jungles and swampland that proved inhospitable to other races, but allowed the lizardmen to thrive in their pyramid-cities.. As the Age of Ice dawned, the jungles were all but destroyed and the swampland froze. Many of the lizardmen died in a panicked exodus to try to escape the bitter cold - their reliance on warm climates meant that they were especially scarred by Mulcarn's entry into creation. The group that would later become the Mazatl took refuge in caves near an inactive volcano, where the heat from the molten earth itself kept them alive. As the Age of Ice passed, the lizards returned to the surface and rebuilt their civilization in the jungle. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Whilst the old civilization worshipped a whole pantheon of gods however, the reborn Mazatl civilization were more focused. They were eternally grateful to Kalshekk - their god of Earth - for protecting them during the Age of Ice, but the followers of Omorr - their god of foresight and learning - gained significant attention when their seers foretold that the world had not been saved from the influences of the Godswar. The icy reign of Mulcarn had been broken, but a time of Fire and Shadow lay ahead, in which the world would suffer the power of Agares himself. The Mazatl have chosen to stand against this fate and seek to avert Armageddon.</English>

        <English>The Mazatl worship a number of different deities, but primarily Kalshekk and Omorr. Whilst none of these deities are exactly the same as those worshipped amongst the human population of Erebus, they do share aspects with some of them. Kalshekk for instance shares many similarities with Kilmorph, to the point that it is believed that both have the same origin but the current representations are derived from differing histories and mythologies. The same is true of the lizard deity Omorr and the human deity Oghma. Whether either race has the "correct" representation is a matter for philosophers and scholars to debate, but what is known is that the Priests of Kalshekk and Omorr display abilities akin to those of their counterpart religions.</English>

[NEWLINE]"We seek audience with Lord Hianthrogh" stated the foremost warrior, "He will see us". The guard looked unsure for a second, before nodding his consent. The party was flanked by twice their number in armoured lizards as they ascended the stone stairs on the exterior of the palace, then onto the steps inlaid with gold that made up the last stretch of the climb. Finally, they reached the top and were ushered into the council chamber of Hianthrogh.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]"I know why you have come and I must agree. Though I still mourn the loss of Nochtli, it is time that we put aside that which has gone before and stand once again in the path of the Sheaim and their allies." The old lizard paused for a second, peering intently at the faces before him. "Do you honestly believe that it can be done?"[NEWLINE]One of the Wyvern Guardians stepped forward and offered a scroll to Hianthrogh. "It can". Hianthrogh studied the scroll for a long moment, before nodding his reply.[NEWLINE]"Yes, I believe it can. Establish your order in every city, train those warriors you deem worthy, prepare our nation for what lies ahead."</English>
