        <English>Much of what is now known of the Age of Rebirth survived only in the libraries of Dural. Vast collections of literature and art, chronicling those early times. The earliest speak of a time of Ice whilst the last speak of Fire. Those records in between however speak often of Dannmos, the leader of the Dural people. Said to be the wisest of men, he shaped his nation in philosophy and geography alike, training the mind as well as the sword arm of his soldiers. That any record survived the Age of Rebirth - and the subsequent Age of Despair - at all is a testament to the vision of the Dural scholars. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Of the man himself, little is known. He kept council with many, but spoke for himself. The wisdom of his words rarely allowed for any disagreement though where opinions differed, he would listen intently and reconsider at length. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Dural were famed as a people dedicated to their arts - it is certain that Dannmos studied the art of leadership, in which he excelled.

        <English>When this Dural Worldspell is cast, every current project in every Dural city receives a boost of 100 hammers towards completion. These hammers are for the current project only and will not overflow to the next project. Most potent once several cities have been constructed, though a flat 100 hammers per city will make less of an impact as the game progresses so timing is important. The spell represents the Dural people's response to a calling - whether it be a call for art and wonder, a call for expansion or a call to arms.</English>

        <English>Occasionally, the colleges will admit members from other empires in order to benefit from cultural exchanges. The Kuriotates often send scholars to the College at Brookden, whilst Newshore College lies a short boat journey from the land of the Bannor. On one such exchange, a man of Bannor visited the college for a time and befriended the young Karrlson. Karrlson was a student of social morality, of laws and codices of all nations in the land. He spoke at length with the Bannor man to learn all he could of the Social Order in his homeland, whilst explaining how he believed the Dural way of life to be more enlightened. The older man smiled at the claim. [NEWLINE]"Boy, you're livin' in the perfect world of the intellectual. Sounds nice, but it ain't where the rest of us are." Karrlson pondered for a moment. [NEWLINE]"But if you chose to make you world as such, then it would become so. It may not be easy, but with work..." The man held up a hand to halt Karrlson's words.[NEWLINE]  "On the 'morrow I will show you the work my people do". [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]True to his word, the next day the Bannor man took Karrlson across the channel and south along the coast of the Bannor empire. Great stone buildings rose from green farmland as they passed, punctuated with hilltop mills and barely seen mines. The further south they travelled however, the fewer people could be seen on the banks. Eventually Karrlson saw smoke drifting across the water and they drew close to the burnt ruins of a settlement. [NEWLINE]"I got word last week that our soldiers stood here to allow the villagers to escape. The peasants were saved, but most of fighting men were lost. This is the work of the orcs and they care little for your 'enlightenment' or ways". Karrlson nodded. He knew of the orcs, even a little of their tribal ways, but had never seen the results of an attack such as this.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Bannor man bowed his head slightly before speaking again. "The sad truth is that the orcs are far from the worst of it. The Veil is winning their war. They've called demons into the world and I don't have a damned notion of how we're going to save anyone from that."[NEWLINE]"Surely they can't have! The compact forbids such direct interference..." The Bannor man turned fiercely, angry for the first time.[NEWLINE]  "You think you've learnt well enough to understand what the gods are upto? You can live in that damned college of your's for your whole life and never understand but a little of what happens in the world. The flames of Agares will come and burn your books long before any of us can truly understand why. I have seen the demons, I fought with their kin and - Junil forgive me - I was mortally afraid."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The man recomposed himself. "I was much impressed by what the Dural have accomplished since the ice melted - your society is truly a wonder, but I wonder how it would fare should Bannor fail to hold the tide from you? How many of you will be able to stand against the horrors that are coming?"[NEWLINE]Karrlson fell silent as the words rang true. After a long moment, he spoke. "I will stand, for as long as I am able" he said. "Please, return me to my home, I have much training to do."</English>
