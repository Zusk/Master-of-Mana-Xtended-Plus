        <English>Zombies are expendable "troops". Since they don't fight in a formation, but rather in an uncontrolled mob, every attempt at using terrain advantages or fighting in cities is futile. Their foul stench can be smelt miles away and paired with their slow movement every enemy has enough time to prepare for an attack. Their craving for flesh makes them good counters to animals.</English>

Are you still getting nervous when the bootlicks of the Empyrean enter your so called cities? Do you still feel a lingering hunger after every feast you take?

You want to judge me, but it is you being judged! The world judges you, for you are abominations in their eyes, an evil that needs to be put down. And I judge you for what you are: Cowards! You are being given the most marvelous gift in the whole of Erebus but still you let the jealousy of those lesser creatures impede on your true nature.
I once was like you, filling the void inside me with endless nights feasting on the puppets in my realm, concealing my true nature from outsiders and myself and living with that disgust for i would not embrace my true nature.

I give you a choice, do like i do or begone! There are only two ways: Be what you are or be swept away by the lesser races."

Following his paradigm the Aristrakh strengthen their vampiric characteristics by consuming the life-force of their realm. Since there are only very few Airstrakh Vampires they have to make use of their necromantic powers to raise an army of undead and even their cities are inhabited by the walking dead. Being mere puppets of the will of their masters, those undead are average warriors at best. It is the endless horde of bones and rotting flesh that gives them their strength to compete with other civilizations. Once the Aristrakh Civilization has significantly progressed, it may attract more Vampires to join their ranks. Those Vampires are more powerful then any Calabim counterpart, or any other comparable creature for that matter. Once a Vampire ascends to Lordship he can use his daunting powers to control the terrifying Dracolich. Since no living creature dares to enter the realm of the Aristrakh, or only with the intend of purging them, Nikephoros taught the Aristrakh his powers to raise warriors of eons long ago to serve them. Doing so however is an affront to every other civilization for they either honor the dead or fear what may happen if the Aristrakh become too strong. Every significant undead army will nourish on the population of the Aristrakh cities, meaning that maintaining a powerful undead legion will most propably cause war with most races.</English>

Following his paradigm the Aristrakh strengthen their vampiric characteristics by consuming the life-force of their realm. Since there are only very few Airstrakh Vampires they have to make use of their necromantic powers to raise an army of undead and even their cities are inhabited by the walking dead.

        <English>Though the legions of the undead walk through the city streets and on the battle fields for the Aristrakh Empire, shocking and terrifying the living populations of foreign nations, the vampire lords find them quite un-amusing. Their preference of the Catacombs is viewed as quite odd by the spies of other nations, that the depths of the dark catacombs entertain, or at the least, comfort the ruling class of Aristrakh. Some of the vampires find inspiration from this place of death and use that inspiration to channel their emotional feelings into music, a surprising skill many of the ancient vampires posses. Some of the spies have observed that there is a correlation in that the longer a vampire dwells in the Catacombs, the more inspired he becomes. Some reports indicate that this "ritual" can last for decades even![NEWLINE]The deep twisting tunnels, and the seemingly never ending turns, passageways with hidden rooms prevent the majority of adventurer's from entering and exposing what secrets lay within the Catacombs. The rumors include places of torture within, this also keeps the casual visitor away. One rumor whispered, is how the vampire lords deal with corruption, administering secret punishments by which they ensure the empire is running as it should be. Another rumor indicates that there are other areas of a dark secretive nature, where they perform rituals to raise the dead to fight for the Aristrakh cause!</English>

        <English>The Decaying Soil radiates from the epicenter from where it is cast, it spreads consuming the earth not yet tainted by its vampiric power. It continues expanding until another force of some "nature" is powerful enough to stop it's growth. As it spreads, it kills any vegetation that it comes into contact with. With with no plantlife in the environment, the plant-eaters depart, and the predators are not far behind them.[NEWLINE]By the end of the ritual, life is completely inhospitable, leaving only room for the dead. The Decaying Soil becomes a deterrent for living organisms, and the lack of living obstacles makes it easier for the undead movement.
