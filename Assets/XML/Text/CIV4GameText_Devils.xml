        <English>With Hyborem invading Erebus, a rival faction from hell has arrived. Because they look quite distinct from the Demons following Hyborem our people call them Devils, although such a distinction might be misleading as they are still creatures from the Vaults of Hell. We don't know of the internal power struggles, what we do know is that their presence will corrupt Erebus even faster. Defeating them and closing their Gates will yield an significant reward. You are good advised by fortifying your realm and getting resistance to fire for your troops.</English>

        <English>With Hyborem invading Erebus, a rival faction from hell has arrived. Their Presence is corrupting Erebus and therefore they are our natural allies. Being master of Dimensional Magic we can summon additional reinforcements for them as long as the world is getting more and more corrupted. Since they came to Erebus to fight Hyborem and his followers we assume this is an internal power struggle. The foolish peasants of the other civilizations call them Devils for their different look and they also don't understand that wars between demon lords are fairly common. We can either decide to help them and thus accelerating the end of the world or we could wage war on them and gain a significant reward for closing the gate.</English>
