        <English>[H1]Magic[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]
Magic plays an important part in Erebus. There are two main types of magic: Arcane and Divine. In order to use arcane magic you need the appropriate knowledge and sufficient mana. You can gather mana from various buildings, such as Mage Guilds, from Scientist specialists or improvements and landmarks, such as Mana Shrines. Check your mana income by hovering your mouse on the mana symbol, on the top left panel of the main screen.

Divine magic is also called miracles. You gain miracles by following a particular religion and gaining Sacred Knowledge of that religion. You then need Faith to power the miracles. Faith can be accumulated through various means, usually by completing a Tribute ritual to your god, by constructing various buildings like Pagan Shrine, by assigning Priest specialists or from Lost Temples found in remote areas.

Both arcane and divine magics have several characteristics:

[H2]Combat aura[\H2]

Arcane and disciple units (and some summons) radiate magical auras which help their allies. These auras are automatically applied to several units in their aura range. Usually, arcane units start with a combat aura range of 1, and can affect 6 units. More promotions can increase the combat aura range or its target. Disciple units may vary. You can see which auras are affecting a unit by looking at the tooltips while hovering over the unit.

You can add more effects to a combat aura through several means. First, researching spells can give all arcane units in your command promotions which boost their combat auras. This will be applied automatically, as soon as you completed the research. Second, you can choose promotions during level up. Most disciple units gain stronger combat aura through promotions.

Some rare units have a hostile combat aura instead. These units, like Priests and High Priests of Octopus Overlords, automatically debuff any hostile units around them. Again, see tooltips of a particular enemy units to know what kind of auras affect it. Each unit can be affected by two friendly and two hostile auras, chosen automatically by the game.

[H2]Damage spells[\H2]

Damage spells are hostile magic harming your enemies. Your adept units can cast damage spells from arcane magic while your priests can cast damage spells from divine magic. Low level damage spells will do a small amount damage to enemies and generally can not kill them. Higher level damage spells can do more damage and even wipe out whole units.

To protect your units from enemy damage spells, bring adepts and priests with your army. Adepts and priests have combat auras which increase resistance toward hostile spells and elemental attacks. You can also choose promotions which grant magic or elemental resistance during level up. There are equipments protecting your units from elemental damage as well.

[H2]Summons[\H2]

Most summons are arcane in nature but there are some divine summons as well. You can complete a summoning ritual by spending the required amount of mana or faith. Each summon will appear in your capital or in a city with a Summoning Circle. Summons require mana to maintain. Usually, summons will have mana affinity, thus getting stronger with each mana type you have.

[H2] Global Enchantments[\H2]

Some spells take form of global enchantments. You cast it once by spending the required amount of mana or faith and the spell will continue taking effect as long as you do not cancel it. Global enchantments will create a temporary building in your cities and give you various beneficial effects.

There are, however, hostile global enchantments that your enemies might cast upon your cities. If suddenly your citizens are restless, check your cities for unusual buildings. You might have been targeted by hostile global enchantments. As long as the caster maintains the spell and they can pay for the upkeep, your cities will continue to suffer. If you have researched Sorcery, you can try to Disjunct the hostile enchantment.

[H2]Terraform[\H2]

You can channel magic, both arcane and divine to terraform your land into something more preferable. You can also cast hostile terraforming spells on your enemy, destroying their lands. Unlike global enchantments, terraforming is a one off spell. You do not need to pay for upkeep. Some global enchantments will provide you protection against hostile terraforming spells.

[H1]Magic[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]
Magic plays an important part in Erebus. There are two main types of magic: Arcane and Divine. In order to use arcane magic you need the appropriate knowledge and sufficient mana. You can gather mana from various buildings, such as Mage Guilds, from Scientist specialists or improvements and landmarks, such as Mana Shrines. Check your mana income by hovering your mouse on the mana symbol, on the top left panel of the main screen.

Divine magic is also called miracles. You gain miracles by following a particular religion and gaining Sacred Knowledge of that religion. You then need Faith to power the miracles. Faith can be accumulated through various means, usually by completing a Tribute ritual to your god, by constructing various buildings like Pagan Shrine, by assigning Priest specialists or from Lost Temples found in remote areas.

Both arcane and divine magics have several characteristics:

[H2]Combat aura[\H2]

Arcane and disciple units (and some summons) radiate magical auras which help their allies. These auras are automatically applied to several units in their aura range. Usually, arcane units start with a combat aura range of 1, and can affect 6 units. More promotions can increase the combat aura range or its target. Disciple units may vary.

[H1]Magic Schools[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]
Each civilization starts with one mana from their Palace. This mana enables the civilization to research various magical knowledge of that particular school, so Fire mana unlocks Fire spells and so on. Click the book icon on the top right screen to browse the Arcane Screen. Below are the brief description of each magic school:

[H2]Life[\H2]

Life magic focuses on healing and protective auras. The positive energy of Life is channeled through enchantments and rituals to empower cities and military units. Life magic also seeks the blessings of gods such as Sirona and Junil, though they are not bound to their religious teachings.

Offensively, Life magic channels positive energy to damage enemies. Life spells have a chance to deal massive damage and the ultimate Life spell, Judgement, will pass the Verdict debuff to enemies hit.

The study of Life magic includes learning the angelic language thus enabling the practitioners to summon angelic hosts.  Mastery of this aspect of Life magic ultimately allows for the summoning of either a Holy Avenger or a Guardian Angel to help further the cause campaigned by the army.


[H2]Nature[\H2]

Nature magic is unique in eschewing direct damage spells. Instead of channeling magical energy through damage spells, Nature magic nurtures and empowers. Practitioners of Nature magic can enchant growth, providing the empire with endless supply of leather, lumber, metal, herbs and stone.

Nature magic relies on animal and beast summons to strengthen their army before summoning Earth elementals using higher level magic. It also enchants friendly animals and beasts with poison claws and regenerative powers, or even Iron Skin which gets stronger with each Nature mana controlled.

Terraforming is the domain of Nature magic. With enough knowledge, Nature mages can rejuvenate barren lands or even vitalise corrupted lands.


[H2]Air[\H2]

Air magic manipulates winds and lightning for the benefit of their civilisation. Practitioners of Air magic can do various things, starting from conjuring gentle rain to increasing yield from grain resources to manipulating the climate of the land. With sufficient knowledge of wind, Air mages can hamper enemy movement while at the same time increasing the mobility of allies.

Air magic spells tap lightning energy and direct it to the enemy. Lightning spells require precision thus can only target few enemies. However, each enemy struck by lightning has the chance to get stunned for few turns.

When the need arises, Air mages can summon Lightning and Air elementals to destroy their enemies. A truly dedicated Air mage is even able to petition for the assistance of a Sylph, beautiful servants of Tali.


[H2]Fire[\H2]

Blazing fire possesses unrivalled destructive force since time immemorial. Even after the fall of the Fire Goddess, Fire magic continues to thrive in Erebus. Using the essence of Fire, mages enchant their allies with unrivalled courage, strengthen them with physical force or even wreath them in living flame.

Fire spells are hard to control but this makes them ideal for destruction. Even a simple Fireball can burn more enemies than spells from other school. When a Fire mage has unraveled deeper knowledge of Fire magic, he will be able to conjure a Meteor Shower upon doomed enemies.

While most fiery angels have fallen with their goddess, some still persist in the form of various Fire elementals. Embers are fickle, weak elementals but can be helpful in destroying large number of enemies through their suicide attacks. Fire elementals are stronger and more organised than their little brothers and mages often conjure them in dire times. However, the ultimate summoning might call the great Fire Drake, supposedly scions of Acheron before the dragon went mad.


[H2]Water[\H2]

The school of Water magic is divided into two branches: liquid Water drawing power from Danalin and the solid Ice of Mulcarn. The Water branch is focused on harvesting the bounty of the sea. But if needed, Water magic can cause floods and destruction to enemies.

Ice magic is more battle oriented. Using Ice magic, mages could drastically reduce their enemies' body temperature, causing them harm and slowing their movement. Higher level Ice spells such as Cold Grip and Frozen Death could affect more enemies in range.

Both Water and Ice provide summons to assist the practitioners of this school. Water summons include Water elementals and the elusive Sea Dragon. Ice summons are mainly Ice elementals.  The greatest of Ice mages might call upon the mighty Frost Titan.


[H2]Mind[\H2]

While other schools focus their attention on manipulating the material world, Mind magic focuses on manipulating the mind and flow of magic itself. Mind magic enchantments can heavily disrupt or even destroy enemy magic, tampering with the minds of their citizens' and even ultimately corrupting the flow of magic for other schools' practitioners.

While does not employ damage spells, Mind mages are very dangerous in combat. They will attack their enemies' mind.  Effects include calming bloodlust, pacifying hostilities and even domination, turning foe into friend. Even enemy mages have to be very careful around Mind mages.

Unlike other schools, Mind magic does not summon reinforcements. Instead, it conjures illusions to fight hostile armies. When they feel that their Phantom Warriors are no longer powerful enough to battle the enemies, Mind mages can strengthen the Phantom Warriors using the Phantasmagoria ritual, making them terribly terrifying.


[H2]Chaos[\H2]

Chaos magic harnesses the unholy power of Entropy but instead of controlling it, Chaos magic distorts it and makes it run wild. Most Chaos spells and enchantments are unpredictable or have serious side effects. Yet, many seek this chaotic power, seduced by their arrogance in believing that they can wield this unworldly power.

Chaos spells shoot unholy power which then explode in the middle of enemy's ranks. Not only does it damage soldiers, these chaotic explosions also displace them, destroying their formations and making them easy prey for the Chaos mages' allies. The ultimate spell, Greater Rift, even tears the fabric of reality and destroys everything caught in the spell. Not many mages are stupid enough to cast it but those who do take delight in the resulting destruction.

Delighted with the workings of Chaos magic, Aeron and Camulos manifested and favoured their chosen with knowledge to summon demonic army. Not ones to turn down power, Chaos mages readily accepted the offer from the gods.


[H2]Death[\H2]

Death magic harnesses the unholy powers in a rigid and meticulous way. If Chaos magic is unpredictable, Death magic is very orderly and precise. Death mages pride themselves in twisting and corrupting nature using trickles of negative energy. Through Death magic, mages send curses and hexes to cripple their enemies.

In the name of efficiency, Death mages condone the practice of necromancy. Corpses and skeletons are no more than materials for their rituals and so the resulting Skeleton Soldiers are as viewed by Death mages the same as the Luchuirp's view their golems. With advanced techniques, Death mages can enslave souls as Spectres or even corrupt angels and elementals, turning them into Wraiths.

One tantalising aspect of Death magic is the possibility of gaining immortality through Lichdom. Mages spend decades studying the arcane nuances of Death magic to find the most efficient and secure way to protect their soul, thus making them both immortal and more receptive to the flow of unholy powers.

The study of Life magic includes learning the angelic language thus enabling the practitioners to summon angelic hosts.  Mastery of this aspect of Life magic ultimately allows for the summoning of either a Holy Avenger or a Guardian Angel to help further the cause campaigned by the army.


[H2]Nature[\H2]

Nature magic is unique in eschewing direct damage spells. Instead of channeling magical energy through damage spells, Nature magic nurtures and empowers. Practitioners of Nature magic can enchant growth, providing the empire with endless supply of leather, lumber, metal, herbs and stone.

Nature magic relies on animal and beast summons to strengthen their army before summoning Earth elementals using higher level magic. It also enchants friendly animals and beasts with poison claws and regenerative powers, or even Iron Skin which gets stronger with each Nature mana controlled.

Terraforming is the domain of Nature magic. With enough knowledge, Nature mages can rejuvenate barren lands or even vitalise corrupted lands.


[H2]Air[\H2]

Air magic manipulates winds and lightning for the benefit of their civilisation. Practitioners of Air magic can do various things, starting from conjuring gentle rain to increasing yield from grain resources to manipulating the climate of the land. With sufficient knowledge of wind, Air mages can hamper enemy movement while at the same time increasing the mobility of allies.

Air magic spells tap lightning energy and direct it to the enemy. Lightning spells require precision thus can only target few enemies. However, each enemy struck by lightning has the chance to get stunned for few turns.

When the need arises, Air mages can summon Lightning and Air elementals to destroy their enemies. A truly dedicated Air mage is even able to petition for the assistance of a Sylph, beautiful servants of Tali.


[H2]Fire[\H2]

Blazing fire possesses unrivalled destructive force since time immemorial. Even after the fall of the Fire Goddess, Fire magic continues to thrive in Erebus. Using the essence of Fire, mages enchant their allies with unrivalled courage, strengthen them with physical force or even wreath them in living flame.

Fire spells are hard to control but this makes them ideal for destruction. Even a simple Fireball can burn more enemies than spells from other school. When a Fire mage has unraveled deeper knowledge of Fire magic, he will be able to conjure a Meteor Shower upon doomed enemies.

While most fiery angels have fallen with their goddess, some still persist in the form of various Fire elementals. Embers are fickle, weak elementals but can be helpful in destroying large number of enemies through their suicide attacks. Fire elementals are stronger and more organised than their little brothers and mages often conjure them in dire times. However, the ultimate summoning might call the great Fire Drake, supposedly scions of Acheron before the dragon went mad.


[H2]Water[\H2]

The school of Water magic is divided into two branches: liquid Water drawing power from Danalin and the solid Ice of Mulcarn. The Water branch is focused on harvesting the bounty of the sea. But if needed, Water magic can cause floods and destruction to enemies.

Ice magic is more battle oriented. Using Ice magic, mages could drastically reduce their enemies' body temperature, causing them harm and slowing their movement. Higher level Ice spells such as Cold Grip and Frozen Death could affect more enemies in range.

Both Water and Ice provide summons to assist the practitioners of this school. Water summons include Water elementals and the elusive Sea Dragon. Ice summons are mainly Ice elementals.  The greatest of Ice mages might call upon the mighty Frost Titan.


[H2]Mind[\H2]

While other schools focus their attention on manipulating the material world, Mind magic focuses on manipulating the mind and flow of magic itself. Mind magic enchantments can heavily disrupt or even destroy enemy magic, tampering with the minds of their citizens' and even ultimately corrupting the flow of magic for other schools' practitioners.

While does not employ damage spells, Mind mages are very dangerous in combat. They will attack their enemies' mind.  Effects include calming bloodlust, pacifying hostilities and even domination, turning foe into friend. Even enemy mages have to be very careful around Mind mages.

Unlike other schools, Mind magic does not summon reinforcements. Instead, it conjures illusions to fight hostile armies. When they feel that their Phantom Warriors are no longer powerful enough to battle the enemies, Mind mages can strengthen the Phantom Warriors using the Phantasmagoria ritual, making them terribly terrifying.


[H2]Chaos[\H2]

Chaos magic harnesses the unholy power of Entropy but instead of controlling it, Chaos magic distorts it and makes it run wild. Most Chaos spells and enchantments are unpredictable or have serious side effects. Yet, many seek this chaotic power, seduced by their arrogance in believing that they can wield this unworldly power.

Chaos spells shoot unholy power which then explode in the middle of enemy's ranks. Not only does it damage soldiers, these chaotic explosions also displace them, destroying their formations and making them easy prey for the Chaos mages' allies. The ultimate spell, Greater Rift, even tears the fabric of reality and destroys everything caught in the spell. Not many mages are stupid enough to cast it but those who do take delight in the resulting destruction.

Delighted with the workings of Chaos magic, Aeron and Camulos manifested and favoured their chosen with knowledge to summon demonic army. Not ones to turn down power, Chaos mages readily accepted the offer from the gods.


[H2]Death[\H2]

Death magic harnesses the unholy powers in a rigid and meticulous way. If Chaos magic is unpredictable, Death magic is very orderly and precise. Death mages pride themselves in twisting and corrupting nature using trickles of negative energy. Through Death magic, mages send curses and hexes to cripple their enemies.

In the name of efficiency, Death mages condone the practice of necromancy. Corpses and skeletons are no more than materials for their rituals and so the resulting Skeleton Soldiers are as viewed by Death mages the same as the Luchuirp's view their golems. With advanced techniques, Death mages can enslave souls as Spectres or even corrupt angels and elementals, turning them into Wraiths.

One tantalising aspect of Death magic is the possibility of gaining immortality through Lichdom. Mages spend decades studying the arcane nuances of Death magic to find the most efficient and secure way to protect their soul, thus making them both immortal and more receptive to the flow of unholy powers.

[H1]Religions[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]
In order to adopt a religion, you need to research Ancient Chants. After acquiring the technology, you will be able to choose a religion. That religion will be present in your capital and you can adopt it.

After adopting a religion, you will start accumulating faith. There are several sources of faith:
- Each city with your state religion present will give you +1 faith per turn.
- Various buildings, like Pagan Temples, will give you faith per turn as well.
- Complete a Tribute ritual to appease your patron god/goddess. The ritual will give you faith and each city will give +1 faith per culture level.
- Lost Temples that are scattered around the map give +5 faith per turn.
- Some units give faith per turn.

Each religion has unique gameplay, strengths and weaknesses. Here is a brief explanation of each:


[H2]The Order[\H2]

The Order worships Junil and seeks to establish his Oath of Dominion to protect Erebus from Armageddon.

The Order excels at organisation, both in civilian and in military sense. By adopting the Order, a civilisation will have reduced maintenance cost, thanks to their efficient priests. On the other hand, it will be easier for Order civilisations to mobilise their general populace to arms and even to declare Holy War against other civilisation.

The Order's miracle includes Bless and Guardian Angel further emphasising their militaristic nature. The Order also hates mages, thus any civilisation adopting the Order will find it hard to conduct arcane research. At times, the Confessors might even launch Arcane Inquisition toward practitioners of magics.


[H2]The Empyrean[\H2]

Servants of Lugus, the Empyrean's main goal is to deliver Light of Redemption to corners of Erebus.

While the Order acts, the Empyrean talks. That saying is accurate to some degree. The Empyrean is less militant than the Order and their priesthood values debates and discussions. The presence of the Empyrean therefore will boost science and GPP rate. With Liberty, Empyrean civilisations can freely assigns unlimited citizens as Bards, Sages, Merchants or Engineers.

The Empyrean is not all talk, though. When times demand it, the Empyrean can also act. Vicars hold holy and fiery power against their enemies. Empyrean's miracles such as Sunlight and Searing Light can immobilise enemy units, allowing Radiant Guards and Rathas to destroy them.


[H2]Runes of Kilmorph[\H2]

Traditionally seen as a Dwarven religion, Runes of Kilmorph has spread to other lands. Its believers' ultimate goal is for all of Erebus to sing the Hymn to Earthmother.

Runes of Kilmorph's core tenets are Dedication, Perseverance and Perfection of Self. Runes of Kilmorph implores believers to be better and master their craft. As such, civilisations adopting Runes of Kilmorph will see increases in its production and income. Their priesthood's affinity toward earth also helps in mining and crafts.

Runes of Kilmorph's blessings are mainly production-oriented, such as Rush Production and Gift of Kilmorph. When faced with hostile enemies Stonewardens will invoke Spiritual Shield and graft runes to grant the strength to face their enemies. Most of the powers of this religion are defensive in nature.


[H2]Fellowship of the Leaves[\H2]

The ascension of Cernunnos as God of Nature brought revitalisation of the Fellowship of the Leaves. Despite that, the religion still lacks central tenets, making sects in the religion have different and often contradictory views on the religion. It is ultimately agreed, however, that Fellowship of the Leaves celebrates the strength and might that nature has bestowed to individuals.

The Fellowship of the Leaves' main focus is on Ancient Forests. Unlike other religions which generate Faith through tribute to their god, Fellowship of the Leaves generates Faith through Ancient Forests. It has miracles such as Enchanted and Mythical Forests to transform forests into Ancient Forests, which in turn generate Faith and protect them from invaders.

Fawns and their older brothers, Satyrs, are capable recon units. They can cast Mesmerize Animals, gaining control over hostile animals units. Thus, for civilisations lacking recon units, adopting the Fellowship might be a worthy option to consider.


[H2]Octopus Overlords[\H2]

Born from the nightmare of Danalins, the believers of the Octopus Overlords recite Chants of Madness and conjure otherworldly nightmares to Erebus.

At first glance, the Octopus Overlords is a great, liberating religion which allows its believers to explore their minds and creativity. Thus, the presence of Octopus Overlords in a civilisation is usually accompanied by bursts of creativity and inventions. However, under the veneer of creativity and exploration dark secrets lurk at the heart of the religion. For each artist or inventor supported by the Cultists there are men and women who are killed, driven insane, addicted, submerged in unholy waters, or worse. In the hand of the Cultists, even dancing festivals can result in dreaded nightmares.

As a manifestation of Danalin's nightmares, the Octopus Overlords claim supremacy over water. However, Condatis, the true archangel of Danalin, is seeking to free her lord from the nightmare. When the religion is founded, Condatis will appear to its enemy for support. Thus, the great battle over waters is commenced and civilisations will be drawn and drowned in the conflict.


[H2]The Ashen Veil[\H2]

A religious movement heralding the triumph of Agares, the Ashen Veil campaigns for the Ending.

The Ashen Veil is about corruption. Their scientific activities are abhorrent experiments. Their religious rituals rely on blood sacrifice. The songs and poetry of the Veil are demon summoning chants. No civilisation will be happy with the Ashen Veil but the powers wielded by the Ritualists tempt many great leaders and cruel tyrants.  Those too weak to claim the power it offers are sacrificed to fuel the ambitions of those who can.

Wreathed in unholy fire, Ritualists channel the unholy power of Agares, burning and scorching, summoning demons and whispering curses. The rituals of Ashen Veils are either openly hostile or have terrible effects outweighing the benefits. But the seductive voice of Agares is tempting - only the wisest can withstand against it.

While the Order acts, the Empyrean talks. That saying is accurate to some degree. The Empyrean is less militant than the Order and their priesthood values debates and discussions. The presence of the Empyrean therefore will boost science and GPP rate. With Liberty, Empyrean civilisations can freely assigns unlimited citizens as Bards, Sages, Merchants or Engineers.

The Empyrean is not all talk, though. When times demand it, the Empyrean can also act. Vicars hold holy and fiery power against their enemies. Empyrean's miracles such as Sunlight and Searing Light can immobilise enemy units, allowing Radiant Guards and Rathas to destroy them.


[H2]Runes of Kilmorph[\H2]

Traditionally seen as a Dwarven religion, Runes of Kilmorph has spread to other lands. Its believers' ultimate goal is for all of Erebus to sing the Hymn to Earthmother.

Runes of Kilmorph's core tenets are Dedication, Perseverance and Perfection of Self. Runes of Kilmorph implores believers to be better and master their craft. As such, civilisations adopting Runes of Kilmorph will see increases in its production and income. Their priesthood's affinity toward earth also helps in mining and crafts.

Runes of Kilmorph's blessings are mainly production-oriented, such as Rush Production and Gift of Kilmorph. When faced with hostile enemies Stonewardens will invoke Spiritual Shield and graft runes to grant the strength to face their enemies. Most of the powers of this religion are defensive in nature.


[H2]Fellowship of the Leaves[\H2]

The ascension of Cernunnos as God of Nature brought revitalisation of the Fellowship of the Leaves. Despite that, the religion still lacks central tenets, making sects in the religion have different and often contradictory views on the religion. It is ultimately agreed, however, that Fellowship of the Leaves celebrates the strength and might that nature has bestowed to individuals.

The Fellowship of the Leaves' main focus is on Ancient Forests. Unlike other religions which generate Faith through tribute to their god, Fellowship of the Leaves generates Faith through Ancient Forests. It has miracles such as Enchanted and Mythical Forests to transform forests into Ancient Forests, which in turn generate Faith and protect them from invaders.

Fawns and their older brothers, Satyrs, are capable recon units. They can cast Mesmerize Animals, gaining control over hostile animals units. Thus, for civilisations lacking recon units, adopting the Fellowship might be a worthy option to consider.


[H2]Octopus Overlords[\H2]

Born from the nightmare of Danalins, the believers of the Octopus Overlords recite Chants of Madness and conjure otherworldly nightmares to Erebus.

At first glance, the Octopus Overlords is a great, liberating religion which allows its believers to explore their minds and creativity. Thus, the presence of Octopus Overlords in a civilisation is usually accompanied by bursts of creativity and inventions. However, under the veneer of creativity and exploration dark secrets lurk at the heart of the religion. For each artist or inventor supported by the Cultists there are men and women who are killed, driven insane, addicted, submerged in unholy waters, or worse. In the hand of the Cultists, even dancing festivals can result in dreaded nightmares.

As a manifestation of Danalin's nightmares, the Octopus Overlords claim supremacy over water. However, Condatis, the true archangel of Danalin, is seeking to free her lord from the nightmare. When the religion is founded, Condatis will appear to its enemy for support. Thus, the great battle over waters is commenced and civilisations will be drawn and drowned in the conflict.


[H2]The Ashen Veil[\H2]

A religious movement heralding the triumph of Agares, the Ashen Veil campaigns for the Ending.

The Ashen Veil is about corruption. Their scientific activities are abhorrent experiments. Their religious rituals rely on blood sacrifice. The songs and poetry of the Veil are demon summoning chants. No civilisation will be happy with the Ashen Veil but the powers wielded by the Ritualists tempt many great leaders and cruel tyrants.  Those too weak to claim the power it offers are sacrificed to fuel the ambitions of those who can.

Wreathed in unholy fire, Ritualists channel the unholy power of Agares, burning and scorching, summoning demons and whispering curses. The rituals of Ashen Veils are either openly hostile or have terrible effects outweighing the benefits. But the seductive voice of Agares is tempting - only the wisest can withstand against it.

[H1]Religions[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]
In order to adopt a religion, you need to research Ancient Chants. After acquiring the technology, you will be able to choose a religion. That religion will be present in your capital and you can adopt it.

After adopting a religion, you will start accumulating faith. There are several sources of faith:
- Each city with your state religion present will give you +1 faith per turn.
- Various buildings, like Pagan Temples, will give you faith per turn as well.
- Complete a Tribute ritual to appease your patron god/goddess. The ritual will give you faith and each city will give +1 faith per culture level.
- Lost Temples that are scattered around the map give +5 faith per turn.
- Some units give faith per turn.

Each religion has unique gameplay, strengths and weaknesses. Here is a brief explanation of each:


[H2]The Order[\H2]

The Order worships Junil and seeks to establish his Oath of Dominion to protect Erebus from Armageddon.

The Order excels at organisation, both in civilian and in military sense. By adopting the Order, a civilisation will have reduced maintenance cost, thanks to their efficient priests. On the other hand, it will be easier for Order civilisations to mobilise their general populace to arms and even to declare Holy War against other civilisation.

The Order's miracle includes Bless and Guardian Angel further emphasising their militaristic nature. The Order also hates mages, thus any civilisation adopting the Order will find it hard to conduct arcane research. At times, the Confessors might even launch Arcane Inquisition toward practitioners of magics.

[H1]FAQs[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]
[H2]1. Guilds[\H2]
1a: How do I unlock Guilds?
Research certain techs like Barter, Currency, or Cartography in the tech tree. After completing the tech, you will be able to choose a new guild to unlock.

1b: How do I advance Guilds?
Accumulate Empire culture using these methods:
- build lots of buildings which grant culture in your cities.
- use Great Bard's Tale of Legend ability.
- fight with units with Bard or Gladiator class.
After you have gathered enough culture, spend them in Guild screen to advance a particular guild.

1c. How many Guilds can I have in a game?
All guilds can be unlocked eventually.


[H2]2. Religion[\H2]
2a: How do I adopt a Religion?
You need to research Ancient Chants. After acquiring the technology, you will be able to choose one religion to spread in your capital.

2b. How do I acquire Sacred Knowledge?
Sacred Knowledge can be obtained by accumulating Faith per turn. Half of your Faith income is used to unlock Sacred Knowledge. The other half is accumulated to power miracles or enchantments.
Mouse over on the Faith symbol in the upper left for further information.

2c. How do I accumulate Faith?
- each city with your religion will gives +1 Faith.
- complete Tribute to... to get more per city. Note that Fellowship of Leaves civs do not get faith from this!
- For FOL, each Ancient Forest will give you Faith.
- some buildings grant Faith (most Pagan Temples etc).
- some units grant Faith per turn (especially The White Hand's disciple units).
- sacrifice a Great Prophet. Note that Faith gained by sacrificing Great Prophet is not directly contributing to Sacred Knowledge. You can spend the accumulated Faith to rush Sacred Knowledge by clicking on the tech tree.


[H2]3. Magic[\H2]
3a. How do I research spells?
You have to obtain the corresponding mana type first then accumulate arcane research through buildings.
Excess mana will be converted to arcane research.
Svartalfar gets a small amount of arcane research from forests and ancient forests.

3b. How do I cast spells?
Use your adepts for tier 1 spells, mages for tier 2 and archmages for the most powerful spells. You need mana to power your spells.

3c. How do I increase spell damage?
Do one or more of the following:
- use higher tier spells (Greater Fireball does more base damage than Fireball).
- choose disciplines/classes/promotions which increase spell damage.
- hoard the appropriate mana type for bonus damage (Fire for Fireball etc).
- complete global enchantments which increase spell damage.

3d. How do I decrease spell damage against my units?
Magic:
- your arcane units start with combat aura which provide magic resistance.
- some arcane knowledges unlock enchantment which give magic resistance or resistance toward certain damage types.
Religion:
- ROK with Rune of Warding.
- Empyrean with Armor of Dawn etc.
Promotions:
- Combat IV and V gives +5% magic resistance each.
- Elemental Resistance (Defense/Divine discipline).
- Cold/Fire/Lightning Resist etc will reduce spell damage.
- Some gear will give extra protection from spell damage.


[H2]4. How do I capture animals?[\H2]
Unlock Ranger's Guild and use recon units to attack and capture animals.  Units that follow the Fellowship of the leaves can also cast the spell Mezmerize Animal which converts animals to your cause.


[H2]5. Equipment[\H2]
5a. How do I equip my unit with gear?
Click on the sword icon on unit panel to open pop up window for gear.
Remember that only level 3 units can use gear.

5b. My unit is level 3+ but the pop up window is empty or only have low quality gear?
Do one or more of the following:
- Research Weaponry or other techs/arcane knowledge to unlock better gear.
- Promote your unit according to what kind of gear you want them to use. Each Disciplines grant access to certain types of weapon/armor.
--- Offense Discipline allows the unit to use Simple and Martial weapons.
--- Defense Discipline allows the unit to use only Simple weapons but all type of armors, etc.


[H2]6. Creating Unit from Combat[\H2]
My class/gear/unit gives me a chance to create unit from combat (Dark Priest class or Skull Dagger gear or Soul Hunter unit etc). But I have never succeeded in creating skeleton/spectre/manes after combat. What gives?
You need to have empty supply slot to trigger this effect.

Even if the created unit is not going to use supply slot, you need one empty supply slot before you can create unit from combat.


[H2]7. Traits[\H2]
7a. What's new on leader traits?
There are several:
- There are new traits, check the in game civilopedia.
- You can use empire culture to buy traits instead of Guild techs.

7b. I can buy traits? How?
- See the the left part of the main screen, under the place shows various summons/enchantments you can cast.
- OR, visit the Guild screen and choose Trait on the bottom of the screen.
- Click the desired trait to buy it using empire culture.

7c. Why there are few traits available for some leaders?
There are five basic traits (Aggressive, Imperial, Creative, Arcane and Faithful). You need to buy basic traits first before you can buy the advanced ones. Check in game civilopedia to learn more about traits.

[H1]Gameoption - Flavor Start[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]
All civilizations start in regions matching their flavour, if such a region is available on the map. This means elves will usually start in heavy forested areas, dwarves in hills, and so on.

[H2]Choke and Vantage point Detection:[\H2] Goblin Forts, Ruins, Forts and sometimes Castles or even Citadels can be found on the map from the beginning. Not anywhere, but at strategic/important choke points. Furthermore, FlavourMod places some Ancient Towers on valuable vantage points to help you survey.
[H2]Flavoured Unique Feature Locations:[\H2] The same as for starting plots is now true for Unique Features. Flavourful locations for each of them. The Maelstrom starts in a rather small sea or ocean (Sto's idea) and The Guardian of Pristin Pass guards a real "pass" in the mountains for example.

[H2]FFH Civilizations: Themes and Flavours[\H2]

Amurites: mage society -> reagents and mana
Bannor: lawful crusaders -> metals, to support their military society and religious fanatism
Balseraphs: crazy mind clowns -> dye, cotton, silk and sheep for colours and dresses
Calabim: vampire aristocraty -> high food potential area, to feed the human stock
Clan of Embers: orcs -> edge of the jungle, Pyre of the Seraphic to sacrifice angels
Doviello: age of ice barbarians -> light tundra, because they like it cold
Elohim: wardens of the secret sites -> all kinds of unique features
Grigori: stay away from the gods and their endless wars -> isolated or as far away as possible, seven pines
Hippus: mercenary horse lords -> flat featureless terrain to support mobility, horses
Illians: winter god worshippers -> snow, tundra, Letum Frigus
Khazad: gold dwarves -> hills, high commerce potential, pigs, gold
Kuriotates: sprawling cities -> three rings of high potential yield plots
Lanun: pirates -> coastal start, pearls
Ljosalfar: light elves -> thick forest, some dislike for colder regions
Luchuirp: dwarven tinkers -> hills, high hammer potential, pigs, marble, ivory
Malakim: desert people lead by an elf -> desert, incense, plains
Sheaim: arcane end of world prophets -> mana, reagents
Sidar: detached immortals -> isolated or as far away as possible
Svartalfar: dark elves -> forest, mana

[H1]Fantasy Mapscripts[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]
There are several fantasy mapscripts included in Wildmana.
[H2]Erebus[\H2]
Mapscript made by Cephalo for Fall from Heaven.
Fantasy worlds often have distinct regions or valleys that have their own special climate or atmosphere. Some examples would be Mordor from LOTR, or most of the regions in World of Warcraft. Well this map script is designed to have various 'valleys' connected to one another through mountain passes, such that each region is kindof a fortress on it's own.

Because this map script was created for FFH2, starting locations and other features are placed based on what is known about each civs fictional terrain preferences. These preferences are tunable toward the beginning of the script
[H2]ErebusContinents[\H2]
Mapscript made by Seven05 for Fall from Heaven.
ErebusContinent is a map script for Fall From Heaven 2 that simulates a single continent or region. The world is generated using a detailed heightmap which is modified by plate tectonics. A climate simulation is run using this heightmap to create realistic climate zones based on the shape of the landmasses and the altitude of the heightmap. Mountain ranges follow the natural plate boundries creating detailed and beliveable mountain ranges and passes and the climate model reflects this with effects such as 'rain shadows' near mountain ranges and lush jungles or forests in areas of heavy rainfall.

Player starting locations are chosen based on the 'flavor' of each civilization. The Malakim will be in the desert, the Illians in the snow, the Lanun on the coast and so on. Every effort is made to ensure the starting locations are also playable and not just flavorful. This means jungles and forests will be cleared around civs that can't take advantage of them and the peaks and hills can be reduced or flattened to ensure you have enough room to grow (and the dwarves have some flat land for food). Some civilizations are also given preferences starting near other civs or off by themselves. In multiplayer games (and only in multiplayer games) civs are less likely to be isolated from the other civs in the game as all civs are encourage to pick the best spot available for them starting furthest from the map edges.

[H2]WildErebus[\H2]
Mapscript made by Zerzes for Civilization4

[ICON_BULLET]It's a regional map with no oceans, but several lakes.
[ICON_BULLET]Lots of easily defended passes and border lines, thanks to an abundance of mountain ridges and snaky lakes. However, it's a dynamic script so wide plains are also possible.
[ICON_BULLET]Fewer luxury and food resources to increase the strategic importance of the existing ones.
[ICON_BULLET]Base food resources. Game in forest, Banana in jungle, Fish in lakes, Wheat in plains.
[ICON_BULLET]Rare resources. Many resources have fewer occurences than the number of players, but with the possibility of one major location with up to 6 adjacent plots with the resource. The owner of such locations will have a good trading position.
[ICON_BULLET]Climate regions. Areas of different climate (desert, tundra, etc) are fractally placed and not tied to latitude.
[ICON_BULLET]Clustered strategic resources. Because who doesn't want to have a city with lots of iron hills?
[ICON_BULLET]All plots on the map can be reached by land. (I believe this script actually works now. It wasn't fool proof in Boreal.)

The goal is that the script should generate a sane map with the possibility to find insane city locations!

[H2]MountainCoast[\H2]
Mapscript made by Lonkero173 for Fall From Heaven
Heavily inspired by J.R.R.Tolien's Middle Earth as well as the "Erebus" map script by Rich Marinaccio

The main point of this script is to create credible mountain ranges that are large enough to be strategically important without overly
disturbing movement. There should rarely be any absolutely critical chokepoints (lone entrances to valleys), but maintaining control of choke points should be important nevertheless

Everytime a unit is built as long as the unit is alive, is not a hero, and is not a settler or worker the terrain around the building city is checked. There is a small chance that the unit will receive a bonus, terrain-oriented promotion based on the current terrain around the city.

Three of the possible promotions are already existing ones:

Winterborn - Based on number of Snow and Tundra tiles (Illians and Doviello are excluded from this check)
Demon-slaying - Based on the number of Hell terrain tiles (Infernal are excluded from this check)
Amphibious - Based on the number of Shore tiles
And three are brand new:

Cliff Walker - Based on the number of Hills and Peak tiles
+10% attack and defense in hills

Sand Devil - Based on the number of Sand tiles
+10% attack and defense in desert

Tree Warden - Based on the number of Forest, Ancient Forest and Jungle tiles (both elven civs have reduced chance to receive this promotion)
+10% attack and defense in Forest, Ancient Forest and Jungle

It is possible (though extremely unlikely) for a single unit to get all six promotions if they have at least one tile that fits into each category around their city.

        <English>[H1]Improvements[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Improvements greatly increase the yields of plots. To build improvements, you need to spend some gold and resources such as lumber or stones. For each improvement you build, the cost of subsequent improvements will increase. Improvements will give various yields when worked by citizens, such as food, production, commerce and others. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Improvements can not be destroyed by barbarians. Razing improvements will gives you some resources and will disable the improvements for a number of turns.
		
[H2]Favoured Improvement[\H2]

Each civilization has a favoured improvement. Building favoured improvements will incur less inflation than regular improvements. You can check what type of improvement favoured by a certain civilization in the Civilizations pedia page.

[H2]Resource Discovery[\H2]
Many improvement types have a chance to discover resources.  The types of resources depend on the improvement type and location in the world.  Resources require active nurturing to properly develop.  A farm in the middle of nowhere will have little access to the knowledge present in cities and not much incentive to generate a surplus.  By integrating your improvements and casting rituals to improve your land it will be so easy to grow almost anything that resources will sprout everywhere.
        
[H2]Land[\H2]
Land resources require specific improvements to discover.  The improvement tooltip will tell you what resources can be discovered.  Certain land bonuses will only spawn in wild lands far from civilization and may even require certain techs in order to discover or properly use.

[ICON_BULLET]The Fertile Lands global enchantment will double the base discovery rate.  It will then add an additional 20% for every nature mana to the new base.

The new base then has the following modifiers added:
[ICON_BULLET][TAB]40% for resources discoverable by mines, quarries, and wineries from the Arid Climate global enchantment
[ICON_BULLET][TAB]40% for food resources, and resources discoverable from lumbermills (and forest lodges), camps, and wineries from the Humid Climate global enchantment
[ICON_BULLET][TAB]50% for food resources, and resources discoverable from lumbermills (and forest lodges), camps, plantations, and wineries from the Evergrow realm global enchantment
[ICON_BULLET][TAB]20% for plantations with both the Arid Climate and Humid Climate global enchantments.

[H2]Gameoptions for Resource Spawning[\H2]
[ICON_BULLET]Increase Resource Spawning on Improvements
If this option is enabled, then the flat bonus for having an adjacent improvement that helps with resource discovery (such as a cottage or trade center) is added and the result is multiplied by 20% for every merchant district in your empire and then doubled if next to an adjacent bonus of that type. if the option is NOT enabled, then the flat bonus for having an adjacent improvement that helps with resource discovery (such as a cottage or trade center) and for every merchant district in your empire are applied only if there is a adjacent bonus of that type (and the result is not doubled).


Note: 
[ICON_BULLET]A single improvement can find many different resource types, and not all of those types will have the same discovery rate.
[ICON_BULLET]All mining resources can be seen from the beginning of the game but certain techs such as the mining guild are needed to actually develop how to use these resources or discover new ones.
[ICON_BULLET]An existing bonus will not be replaced by a new bonus should a different improvement be built.  
[ICON_BULLET]The bonus to having a neighboring bonus will only be applied once, but all improvements that grant a bonus to resource discovery will improve the chances of discovering a bonus.

[H2]Sea[\H2]
All water tiles in a civilization's borders have a base chance to spawn resources but the base disovery chance for water based resources is much lower than on land, and if Gameoptions for Resource Spawning is not enabled resources will not spawn at all in water.

Base chance:
[ICON_BULLET]Adjacent plots with a bonus and the improvement significantly increases the base spawn chance.
[ICON_BULLET][TAB]Whales eat fish and so an adjacent fish bonus will double their discovery chance.
[ICON_BULLET][TAB]Whales don't give a bonus spawn chance to any sea resource.
[ICON_BULLET]The Riches of the Sea global enchantment increases the base discovery chance by 20% for each water mana.

[ICON_BULLET]Certain improvements such as pirate coves give a flat bonus to discovery rate.

The following modifiers are then added:
[ICON_BULLET]100% - Seafaring tech
[ICON_BULLET]100% - Kelp 
[ICON_BULLET]50% - State religion is Octopus Overlords
[ICON_BULLET]50% - Owning city has a harbor
[ICON_BULLET]20% - Player owns the Heron Throne
[ICON_BULLET]50% - Mouth of a river

A map option has been added to remove resources from the game at the start:
[TAB]The age of ice changed everything.  Glaciers moved hills and diverted rivers.  Topsoil was moved from one place to another.  Knowledge was lost and only the most hardy species survived.  Everything has to be rebuilt.

[H2]Cottages and trade centers[\H2]
Cottages and trade centers represent the settling of your people outside the city center.  Doing so allows the population to be closer to the land and as such promises rich rewards for those brave, foolhardy, or greedy enough to venture outside the safety of the city walls.  Increasing those opportunities will mean they develop faster.

Bonuses to growth for improvements that assist other improvements in discovering resources (i.e. cottages and trade centers):
[ICON_BULLET]+1 for being next to an improvement that can discover resources. Doesn't apply to quick and normal gamespeeds.

      <French>[H1]Improvements[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Improvements greatly increase the yields of plots. To build improvements, you need to spend some gold and resources such as lumber or stones. For each improvement you build, the cost of subsequent improvements will increase. Improvements will give various yields when worked by citizens, such as food, production, commerce and others. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Improvements can not be destroyed by barbarians. Razing improvements will gives you some resources and will disable the improvements for a number of turns.
		
[H2]Favoured Improvement[\H2]

Each civilization has a favoured improvement. Building favoured improvements will incur less inflation than regular improvements. You can check what type of improvement favoured by a certain civilization in the Civilizations pedia page.

[H2]Resource Discovery[\H2]
Many improvement types have a chance to discover resources.  The types of resources depend on the improvement type and location in the world.  Resources require active nurturing to properly develop.  A farm in the middle of nowhere will have little access to the knowledge present in cities and not much incentive to generate a surplus.  By integrating your improvements and casting rituals to improve your land it will be so easy to grow almost anything that resources will sprout everywhere.
        
[H2]Land[\H2]
Land resources require specific improvements to discover.  The improvement tooltip will tell you what resources can be discovered.  Certain land bonuses will only spawn in wild lands far from civilization and may even require certain techs in order to discover or properly use.

[ICON_BULLET]The Fertile Lands global enchantment will double the base discovery rate.  It will then add an additional 20% for every nature mana to the new base.

The new base then has the following modifiers added:
[ICON_BULLET][TAB]40% for resources discoverable by mines, quarries, and wineries from the Arid Climate global enchantment
[ICON_BULLET][TAB]40% for food resources, and resources discoverable from lumbermills (and forest lodges), camps, and wineries from the Humid Climate global enchantment
[ICON_BULLET][TAB]50% for food resources, and resources discoverable from lumbermills (and forest lodges), camps, plantations, and wineries from the Evergrow realm global enchantment
[ICON_BULLET][TAB]20% for plantations with both the Arid Climate and Humid Climate global enchantments.

[H2]Gameoptions for Resource Spawning[\H2]
[ICON_BULLET]Increase Resource Spawning on Improvements
If this option is enabled, then the flat bonus for having an adjacent improvement that helps with resource discovery (such as a cottage or trade center) is added and the result is multiplied by 20% for every merchant district in your empire and then doubled if next to an adjacent bonus of that type. if the option is NOT enabled, then the flat bonus for having an adjacent improvement that helps with resource discovery (such as a cottage or trade center) and for every merchant district in your empire are applied only if there is a adjacent bonus of that type (and the result is not doubled).

Note: 
[ICON_BULLET]A single improvement can find many different resource types, and not all of those types will have the same discovery rate.
[ICON_BULLET]All mining resources can be seen from the beginning of the game but certain techs such as the mining guild are needed to actually develop how to use these resources or discover new ones.
[ICON_BULLET]An existing bonus will not be replaced by a new bonus should a different improvement be built.  
[ICON_BULLET]The bonus to having a neighboring bonus will only be applied once, but all improvements that grant a bonus to resource discovery will improve the chances of discovering a bonus.

[H2]Sea[\H2]
All water tiles in a civilization's borders have a base chance to spawn resources but the base disovery chance for water based resources is much lower than on land, and if Gameoptions for Resource Spawning is not enabled resources will not spawn at all in water.

Base chance:
[ICON_BULLET]Adjacent plots with a bonus  and the improvement significantly increases the base spawn chance.
[ICON_BULLET][TAB]Whales eat fish and so an adjacent fish bonus will double their discovery chance.
[ICON_BULLET][TAB]Whales don't give a bonus spawn chance to any sea resource.
[ICON_BULLET]The Riches of the Sea global enchantment increases the base discovery chance by 20% for each water mana.

[ICON_BULLET]Certain improvements such as pirate coves give a flat bonus to discovery rate.

The following modifiers are then added:
[ICON_BULLET]100% - Seafaring tech
[ICON_BULLET]100% - Kelp 
[ICON_BULLET]50% - State religion is Octopus Overlords
[ICON_BULLET]50% - City has a harbor
[ICON_BULLET]20% - Player owns the Heron Throne
[ICON_BULLET]50% - Mouth of a river

A map option has been added to remove resources from the game at the start:
[TAB]The age of ice changed everything.  Glaciers moved hills and diverted rivers.  Topsoil was moved from one place to another.  Knowledge was lost and only the most hardy species survived.  Everything has to be rebuilt.

[H2]Cottages and trade centers[\H2]
Cottages and trade centers represent the settling of your people outside the city center.  Doing so allows the population to be closer to the land and as such promises rich rewards for those brave, foolhardy, or greedy enough to venture outside the safety of the city walls.  Increasing those opportunities will mean they develop faster.

Bonuses to growth for improvements that assist other improvements in discovering resources (i.e. cottages and trade centers):
[ICON_BULLET]+1 for being next to an improvement that can discover resources. Doesn't apply to quick and normal gamespeeds.
[ICON_BULLET]+1 for being connected to the trade network and being connected via a route to an adjacent improvement that can discover resources.  
[TAB]Civilizations that cannot build transport improvements get this for free.
[ICON_BULLET]+1 for being next to an existing bonus that is connected to the trade network and connected via a route. Doesn't apply to quick and normal gamespeeds.

[ICON_BULLET]+1 for being connected to the trade network and being connected via a road
