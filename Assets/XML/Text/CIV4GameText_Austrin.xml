		<English>The Austrin are explorers. All civilizations are naturally drawn to discover what lies outside their walls - knowing of threats and opportunities is essential to their development - but for the Austrin the need is compelling. They did not exist as an organized people before the Age of Ice - they could be identified only as the loners who defied the advice of the village elders and walked the frozen lands around the village. During the time that the ice receded, they were among the first to take to the wilds. Many were surprised to see others there at all, but when they did meet they found kindred spirits.[PARAGRAPH]Eventually they began to settle, often in the furthest reaches of a windswept moor or heath. Their cities are practical constructions - roughly built yet designed to endure - where young Austrin are prepared to make their way in the world.[PARAGRAPH]The defacto leader of the Austrin is Deirdra - a prolific wanderer and self stated worshipper of Tali, though few among the Austrin have ever seen her perform any form of religious rite to prove her devotion. Those who know better realize that worshipping Tali is generally a personal matter and better suited to a mountaintop than a temple and Deirdra often travels to find such a place when she faces a difficult choice on behalf of her people. To outsiders, she is enigmatic yet charming, often seemiming whimsical - though if a foreign diplomat mistakes this for a weakness of character which can be exploited, they swiftly discover this is not the case.[PARAGRAPH]Whilst the Austrin are generally aware of and appreciate Tali's nature, his worship is not a principle religion amongst them. Their settlements often have temples dedicated to various powers, even to Kilmorph who is traditionally the antithesis of Tali (for a time a group worshipping Kilmorph became quite prominent in Telynohn, though their popularity fluctuated and waned - the Austrin often change their mind).[PARAGRAPH]More important than religion to most Austrin however is the Exploration Guild. This started as a loose group of explorers who combined their efforts to chart the surrounding lands, but has since grown to be a place of training and preparation for the young as well as a respite for those too elderly to travel the world anymore. The first charts have become atlases and the guild claims to know more about the world than even the omniscient seers of the neighbouring Amurites. Despite the wealth of knowledge the guild holds, the Austrin are still drawn to that which lies beyond their maps - the unknown.</English>

		<English>A recurve bow is a form of bow defined by the side-view profile; in contrast to the simple longbow, a recurve bow has tips that curve away from the archer when the bow is unstrung. By one technical definition, the difference between recurve and other bows is that the string touches sections of the limbs of recurve bows when the bow is strung. A recurve bow stores more energy than an equivalent straight-limbed bow, giving a greater amount of cast to the arrow. A recurve will permit a shorter bow than the simple bow for a given arrow energy and this form was preferred by archers in environments where long weapons could be cumbersome, such as in brush and forest terrain, or while on horseback. By contrast, the traditional straight longbow tends to "stack" that is, the required draw force increases more rapidly per unit of draw length as the string is drawn back.</English>

		<English>The ocean spread before him, Harmatt breathed in the salt-air. He had travelled the breadth of this land, from Telynohn to the Great Western Sea. Now he could travel no more, as the water stretched out to the north and south, forming a barrier. Yet the horizon still called him. This was not the edge of the world, he could feel it. There was more to find, to see.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As night fell, he crept back to the Amurite port. Ships travelled along the coast at all hours to dock at Glorairine, though they were mostly cargo ships - ugly, cumbersome and ill-suited to a voyage on untamed waves. Then he saw it. A cruiser - simple and elegant lines, designed for speed, belonging to some high-ranking mage who needed to travel between the Amurite cities and beyond rapidly.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Harmatt held no antipathy toward the Amurites - in fact they'd been nothing but accomadating when he'd paid Cervedes a visit. He needed to sail however and the cruiser was the key to that. He quickly slipped on board and darted across the main deck. The craft was designed for a crew of a dozen or more, but he had sailed far larger crafts alone in the past - the winds favoured him. Checking that there were none aboard, he sliced the mooring ropes and prepared to make way.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It would not move. He had spent minutes that felt like a lifetime trying to set sail, but the vessel was stuck fast. The small anchor had been raised, the moorings were cleared and the sails had been dropped enough to manoeuvre (though hopefully not enough to attract attention from the docks) - but still it refused to move. Knowing that time was short, Harmatt opened the sails full, hoping that a sail full of wind would pull him free of the unseen obstruction. The ship lurched uncertainly, then began to vibrate, but still it refused to move.[NEWLINE]A light on the dockside alerted him to the approach of guards, he could flee into the water, but despite being a strong swimmer, he doubted he could outpace an archer's arrow. He stood his ground as the guards laid a gang plank and boarded the ship.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At their head stood a mage. "What exactly are you doing here, in the dead of night? Speak quickly, lest I think you a thief"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]  "Surely not a thief", said Harmatt. "I am merely here to render this vessel seaworthy once more - something unseen has snared it and the owner wished me to free it". The Mage looked amused.[NEWLINE]This vessel will become seaworthy only when its owner wishes it to be so. This is the personal transport of Archmage Govannon - without his magic, it will never move."[NEWLINE]  "Oh. Drat. I guess it's not what I needed afterall then. The water it is..." Before the Amurites could respond, he had darted back several feet and flung himself from the deck, over the side of the boat. The guards ran to the rail as something heavy splashed into the water and seconds later the area was showered with arrows. They waited several minutes, but naught but the thief's hat surfaced.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Hanging on grimly to the underside of the anchor, Harmatt lamented the loss of his hat and swordbelt - cast into the water as he made his escape. This was not turning out to be a good night...</English>

		<English>Trained not in cramped barracks, but out on the hillsides of erebus, Highlanders are the core of an Austrin offensive army. They live their lives camping out in glens and forests, hunting for food, honing their survival skills, fighting wild beasts, and sparring for training. This lifestyle gives them a natural affinity for rough terrain, and a good experience of fending off wild animals.[PARAGRAPH:1][PARAGRAPH:1]They carry a large Claymore on their back, a powerful and flexible greatsword that is carried like a polearm, but swung like a sword. The base of the blade is blunted and wrapped in dark cloth, giving an extra place to grip when holding it at the ready, and both hands are moved down to the hilt when swinging, allowing it to gather massive momentum from its huge arc of motion. Such a weapon favours combat in open spaces, though. And unlike their city-dwelling cousins, they are not well used to fighting on cramped battlements and castle hallways, much preferring combat in the field.</English>
		<French>Exerc pas dans les casernes  l'etroit, mais dehors sur les flancs de coteau de l'erebus, les montagnards sont le noyau d'une arme d'offensive d'Austrin.

Ce style de vie donne leur une affinit normale pour le terrain accident, et  une bonne exprience de dfendre outre des animaux sauvages.[PARAGRAPH:1][PARAGRAPH:1]Ils portent un grand Claymore sur leur dos, un greatsword puissant et flexible qui est port comme un polearm, mais balanc comme une pe. La base de la lame est mousse et envelopp en tissu fonc, donnant un endroit supplmentaire pour saisir quand le tenir le prt, et aux deux mains sont abaisss  la poigne en balanant, lui permettant de recueillir l'lan massif de son arc norme de mouvement. Une telle arme favorise le combat dans les espaces ouverts, cependant. Et  la diffrence de leurs cousins de ville-logement, ils ne sont pas bons utiliss au combat sur les remparts  l'etroit et ne se retranchent pas les vestibules, beaucoup de combat de prfrence dans le domaine.</French>
