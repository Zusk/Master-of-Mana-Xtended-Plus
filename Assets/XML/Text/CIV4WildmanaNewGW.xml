        <Tag>TXT_KEY_SLAVERY_QUOTE</Tag>
        <English>[TAB]Slavery is a system whereby some people are judged far inferior to others and are treated as objects or possessions, with no more rights than those afforded to chairs or cattle. Slavery has existed as long as human history, from the earliest primitive times to the enlightened days of Greece and Rome and right up until today. Sometimes convicted criminals were made into slaves. Sometimes captured enemies of the state were enslaved. Sometimes people of a specific race or coloration were enslaved. In some civilizations a person could purchase their freedom or were allotted it after being enslaved for a specific period of time. [PARAGRAPH:2]The advantage of slavery is that it allows people to be forced to do jobs that they would otherwise refuse to do without adequate compensation. Cheap labor results in concentration of wealth and thus the creation of great buildings and temples or the maintenance of large professional armies. Aside from its basic moral repugnance, the disadvantages of slavery are numerous: it corrupts both slave and master, it badly underutilizes the intelligence and creativity of the subject people, and it almost inevitably leads to revolts and internal strife. </English>
		<French>[TAB]L'esclavagisme est un syst&#232;me par lequel une cat&#233;gorie de gens est consid&#233;r&#233;e comme tr&#232;s inf&#233;rieure. Ces derniers sont trait&#233;s comme des objets ou des biens, et n'ont aucun droit si ce n'est ceux accord&#233;s aux chaises ou au b&#233;tail. L'esclavage est aussi vieux que l'humanit&#233; ; il &#233;tait d&#233;j&#224; pr&#233;sent dans les civilisations primitives, &#233;tait pratiqu&#233; dans la Gr&#232;ce et la Rome antiques, et perdure encore aujourd'hui. Les gens r&#233;duits en esclavage &#233;taient les criminels, les ennemis vaincus, ou les gens de telle ou telle origine. Dans certaines civilisations, les individus pouvaient racheter leur libert&#233;, ou la r&#233;cup&#233;raient automatiquement apr&#232;s un certain de temps. [PARAGRAPH:2]L'avantage de l'esclavage est qu'il permet de forcer des gens &#224; accomplir certaines t&#226;ches qu'ils auraient sinon refus&#233;es de faire sans &#234;tre correctement r&#233;mun&#233;r&#233;s. Cette main-d'oeuvre bon march&#233; permet de concentrer la richesse et de cr&#233;er de somptueux b&#226;timents et lieux de culte ou d'entretenir de vastes arm&#233;es. En plus d'&#234;tre moralement r&#233;pugnant, l'esclavage a de nombreux inconv&#233;nients : il corrompt autant le ma&#238;tre que l'esclave, il sous-exploite l'intelligence et la cr&#233;ativit&#233; des individus soumis, et conduit presque in&#233;vitablement &#224; la r&#233;volte et aux conflits internes. </French>
		<German>[TAB]Der Begriff "Sklaverei" beschreibt ein System, in dem Menschen als minderwertig betrachtet werden und kaum mehr Rechte als ein Stuhl oder ein St&#252;ck Vieh genie&#223;en. Die Sklaverei ist so alt wie die Menschheit selbst. Hielten sich zun&#228;chst primitive St&#228;mme Sklaven, bl&#252;hte bald auch im aufgekl&#228;rten Griechenland und im antiken Rom der Sklavenhandel. Sklaven waren in der Regel verurteilte Verbrecher, Kriegsgefangene, Angeh&#246;rige anderer V&#246;lker oder Menschen einer bestimmten Hautfarbe. In einigen Kulturen konnte sich ein Sklave freikaufen oder wurde von seinem Herrn freigelassen. [PARAGRAPH:2]Der Vorteil der Sklaverei liegt auf der Hand: Sklaven sind billige Arbeitskr&#228;fte, die entscheidend zum Wohlstand ihrer Herren beitrugen. Letztere waren dadurch in der Lage, gewaltige Tempel zu errichten oder stehende Heere zu unterhalten. Abgesehen vom moralischen Aspekt hat die Sklaverei allerdings einen entscheidenden Nachteil: Sie f&#252;hrt fast immer zu inneren Spannungen und Aufst&#228;nden.</German>
		<Italian>[TAB]Lo Schiavismo è un sistema sociale fondato in buona parte sulla schiavitù. La schiavitù, storicamente, è la condizione per cui un individuo perde tutti i diritti di persona libera e diventa proprietà di un altro individuo. Il proprietario di uno schiavo aveva diritto di vita e di morte su di esso e sulla sua famiglia, e aveva diritto a sfruttarne il lavoro senza fornire nessun compenso per esso. Spesso il costo per il lavoro degli schiavi era limitato al necessario per la loro sopravvivenza. Uno schiavo poteva nascere in questa condizione, se figlio di schiavi, oppure poteva perdere la libertà in determinate situazioni, la più comune delle quali era la cattura in guerra.[PARAGRAPH:1]Lo schiavismo era ampiamente praticato ed accettato nella gran parte delle civiltà antiche, ed era regolato dalle leggi e dalle consuetudini come ogni altra pratica economica. Tra le antiche civiltà, quella romana ha rappresentato il culmine delle società schiavistiche, nelle quali il lavoro degli schiavi rappresentava una componente essenziale dell'economia. Anche l'antica Grecia basava gran parte della sua economia sugli schiavi, tanto è vero che ad Atene per lunghi periodi ci sono stati più schiavi che uomini liberi.</Italian>
		<Spanish>[TAB]El esclavismo es un sistema en el que parte de la poblaci&#243;n, considerada inferior al resto y despojada de sus derechos, recibe un tratamiento equiparable al del ganado o las posesiones materiales. La esclavitud ha existido durante toda la historia: desde los tiempos m&#225;s primitivos hasta nuestros d&#237;as, pasando por la luminosa &#233;poca de Roma y Grecia.  A veces, los criminales convictos eran condenados a la esclavitud. Otras, los enemigos del estado capturados sufr&#237;an este destino. Y otras, lo sufr&#237;a la gente de una raza o un color concretos. En algunas civilizaciones, una persona pod&#237;a comprar su libertad, o la recib&#237;a tras un periodo de esclavitud estipulado. [PARAGRAPH:2]La ventaja del sistema esclavista es que a los esclavos se les pueden imponer trabajos que cualquier persona se negar&#237;a a hacer sin recibir una compensaci&#243;n adecuada. La mano de obra barata permite la concentraci&#243;n de capital y, consecuentemente, la creaci&#243;n de grandes edificios y templos, o el mantenimiento de grandes ej&#233;rcitos profesionales. Aparte de los m&#225;s evidentes aspectos morales, las desventajas del esclavismo son numerosas: corrompe al esclavo y al amo, derrocha terriblemente la inteligencia y creatividad de los esclavos y acaba desembocando casi inevitablemente en revueltas y conflictos civiles. </Spanish>

		<English>[TAB]Slavery is a system whereby some people are judged far inferior to others and are treated as objects or possessions, with no more rights than those afforded to chairs or cattle. Slavery has existed as long as human history, from the earliest primitive times to the enlightened days of Greece and Rome and right up until today. Sometimes convicted criminals were made into slaves. Sometimes captured enemies of the state were enslaved. Sometimes people of a specific race or coloration were enslaved. In some civilizations a person could purchase their freedom or were allotted it after being enslaved for a specific period of time. [PARAGRAPH:2]The advantage of slavery is that it allows people to be forced to do jobs that they would otherwise refuse to do without adequate compensation. Cheap labor results in concentration of wealth and thus the creation of great buildings and temples or the maintenance of large professional armies. Aside from its basic moral repugnance, the disadvantages of slavery are numerous: it corrupts both slave and master, it badly underutilizes the intelligence and creativity of the subject people, and it almost inevitably leads to revolts and internal strife. </English>

		<Italian>[TAB]Lo Schiavismo è un sistema sociale fondato in buona parte sulla schiavitù. La schiavitù, storicamente, è la condizione per cui un individuo perde tutti i diritti di persona libera e diventa proprietà di un altro individuo. Il proprietario di uno schiavo aveva diritto di vita e di morte su di esso e sulla sua famiglia, e aveva diritto a sfruttarne il lavoro senza fornire nessun compenso per esso. Spesso il costo per il lavoro degli schiavi era limitato al necessario per la loro sopravvivenza. Uno schiavo poteva nascere in questa condizione, se figlio di schiavi, oppure poteva perdere la libertà in determinate situazioni, la più comune delle quali era la cattura in guerra.[PARAGRAPH:1]Lo schiavismo era ampiamente praticato ed accettato nella gran parte delle civiltà antiche, ed era regolato dalle leggi e dalle consuetudini come ogni altra pratica economica. Tra le antiche civiltà, quella romana ha rappresentato il culmine delle società schiavistiche, nelle quali il lavoro degli schiavi rappresentava una componente essenziale dell'economia. Anche l'antica Grecia basava gran parte della sua economia sugli schiavi, tanto è vero che ad Atene per lunghi periodi ci sono stati più schiavi che uomini liberi.</Italian>

		<English>Two men, one young, tall, and handsome, the other short, fat, and balding, sat across from each other on the patio of Hexam's finest pub. The place's other patrons, an old man who sat watching the setting sun, two women who sat giggling and exchanging flirtations, and one of the best looking whores Hexam had ever seen, paid them no mind. The Horned Rooster's decorations were tastefully gaudy (insofar as such a thing could exist) and its drinks generally had no more effects than those advertised. Its patio overlooked the finest beach in the Balseraph Empire. But the two sitting at a table by the patio's edge had come together to do more than contemplate the oceans, or ogle those on its beach.

		The younger said, "the problem is simply that nobody has a firm definition of what an illusion is. Any time somebody offers a firm definition, they discover that something they believed was real is, by their own definition, an illusion. Or confess that my creations are not illusions. If you don't believe me, Ozziel, then try me." The elder, Ozziel, said "very well, Nojah. An illusion is something which is not real, but takes on the appearance of being real." Nojah laughed, and said, "oh, come. I'd expected better of you! Define real, then!" Ozziel sighed and looked into his glass. He'd not had anything to drink but strawberry wine, and in small amounts, as he'd been warned dealing with Nojah would test one's wits to their very ends. Ozziel said, "something is real if it has a distinct effect upon the world around it, and is effected by the world around it." Nojah said, "then say I create an illusory Balor, and set it loose amongst some Bannor. Would the creature not have a 'distinct effect?' And I am perfectly capable of enchanting it to bleed should it meet steel, thus fulfilling the requirement that it be effected by the world around it."

		Ozziel nodded his assent. "Very well, Nojah," he said. "You illusions can effect the senses of sight, sound, and smell. But what of touch and taste? Can you deceive those as well?" With a flick of his wrist, Nojah summoned an apple and tossed it to Ozziel. He caught it; it flickered briefly, and Ozziel knew that was Nojah demonstrating that, despite appearances, the apple he held was nothing more than the product of his senses being deceived. Ozziel tossed it from hand to hand, impressed by the precision of the illusion, before taking a bite. "It tastes like apple cider," he exclaimed, and greedily devoured it. He was about to dispose of the core when it burst into flame; he shrieked in terror and clutched his hand, which throbbed with pain, but was unmarked. Nojah snapped his fingers, and the taste in his mouth, the feeling of fullness in his stomach, and the pain in his hand, all vanished without a trace.

		Ozziel stared, dumbfounded, while Nojah merely smiled. He said, "my dear Ozziel, you underestimate me. Or perhaps overestimate the peoples of Erebus. Humanity is nothing more than the senses with which we take in information, and the mind which reacts to, yet is molded by, that information. I cannot create physical food, but I can turn the most drab of foods into a delicious treat. Or trick the starving into thinking their bellies are full even as they fall into Arwan's arms. I can bring pleasure and pain, or convince people that one is the other. I can make a slave shriek with joy at every lash of the whip... or, if I prefer, make the slave driver feel every blow he places upon his charges." Nojah then pointed to the pretty whore, saying, "what do you make of her?" Ozziel said, "Let me guess, she's an illusion?" Nojah said, "maybe. She might also be an ugly whore who I have given the appearance of a pretty one. Or precisely what she appears to be? You see, by controlling the information granted to your senses, I may as well have control over all of reality. How will you be able to tell the difference between the falsehoods I feed your mind, and what you deem 'reality,' which might well simply be falsehoods fed you by another?" Ozziel said, "by cheating."

		The old man, hearing the signal, released the incantation he had prepared earlier. There was a great burst of light; when it faded, everything had changed. The wine in Ozziel's cup had turned to cheap, watered down rum, and the paint of the Horned Rooster had become faded. The whore's true form turned out to be an old, gnarled wench, and she glared with raw hatred at the one who had dispelled the illusion about her. The two women who had been flirting were both revealed to be men; they stared at each other with shock and disgust before quickly packing and leaving, red-faced. Nojah, although still younger and more handsome than Ozziel had expected, was now stark naked. He sighed, waved his illusory clothes back on, and said, "well played. But frankly, you have merely dodged the points I was trying to make about reality and the senses. Had you not had that friend of yours... how did you talk him into it, anyways?" Ozziel said, "He wanted a chance to preach to the Balseraphs, and I said I'd help him around town if he'd do that little magic trick. But about that point about reality and the senses; yes, I suppose there are a lot of illusions in the world. Others may disagree, but I've always felt all of society is nothing but a shared illusion; I suppose all we can do is trust our senses and our hearts." Nojah said, "indeed. Hearts always have been slightly harder to manipulate than senses," he said, as he left. "Wait, only slightly harder?" Ozziel muttered, worried, as he watched the Illusionist disappear into the crowds of Hexam.</English>

Nojah said, "then say I create an illusory Balor, and set it loose amongst some Bannor. Would the creature not have a 'distinct effect?' And I am perfectly capable of enchanting it to bleed should it meet steel, thus fulfilling the requirement that it be effected by the world around it."

		Ozziel nodded his assent. "Very well, Nojah," he said. "You illusions can effect the senses of sight, sound, and smell. But what of touch and taste? Can you deceive those as well?" With a flick of his wrist, Nojah summoned an apple and tossed it to Ozziel. He caught it; it flickered briefly, and Ozziel knew that was Nojah demonstrating that, despite appearances, the apple he held was nothing more than the product of his senses being deceived. Ozziel tossed it from hand to hand, impressed by the precision of the illusion, before taking a bite. "It tastes like apple cider," he exclaimed, and greedily devoured it. He was about to dispose of the core when it burst into flame; he shrieked in terror and clutched his hand, which throbbed with pain, but was unmarked. Nojah snapped his fingers, and the taste in his mouth, the feeling of fullness in his stomach, and the pain in his hand, all vanished without a trace.

		Ozziel stared, dumbfounded, while Nojah merely smiled. He said, "my dear Ozziel, you underestimate me. Or perhaps overestimate the peoples of Erebus. Humanity is nothing more than the senses with which we take in information, and the mind which reacts to, yet is molded by, that information. I cannot create physical food, but I can turn the most drab of foods into a delicious treat. Or trick the starving into thinking their bellies are full even as they fall into Arwan's arms. I can bring pleasure and pain, or convince people that one is the other. I can make a slave shriek with joy at every lash of the whip... or, if I prefer, make the slave driver feel every blow he places upon his charges." Nojah then pointed to the pretty whore, saying, "what do you make of her?" Ozziel said, "Let me guess, she's an illusion?" Nojah said, "maybe. She might also be an ugly whore who I have given the appearance of a pretty one. Or precisely what she appears to be? You see, by controlling the information granted to your senses, I may as well have control over all of reality. How will you be able to tell the difference between the falsehoods I feed your mind, and what you deem 'reality,' which might well simply be falsehoods fed you by another?" Ozziel said, "by cheating."

		The old man, hearing the signal, released the incantation he had prepared earlier. There was a great burst of light; when it faded, everything had changed. The wine in Ozziel's cup had turned to cheap, watered down rum, and the paint of the Horned Rooster had become faded. The whore's true form turned out to be an old, gnarled wench, and she glared with raw hatred at the one who had dispelled the illusion about her. The two women who had been flirting were both revealed to be men; they stared at each other with shock and disgust before quickly packing and leaving, red-faced. Nojah, although still younger and more handsome than Ozziel had expected, was now stark naked. He sighed, waved his illusory clothes back on, and said, "well played. But frankly, you have merely dodged the points I was trying to make about reality and the senses. Had you not had that friend of yours... how did you talk him into it, anyways?" Ozziel said, "He wanted a chance to preach to the Balseraphs, and I said I'd help him around town if he'd do that little magic trick. But about that point about reality and the senses; yes, I suppose there are a lot of illusions in the world. Others may disagree, but I've always felt all of society is nothing but a shared illusion; I suppose all we can do is trust our senses and our hearts." Nojah said, "indeed. Hearts always have been slightly harder to manipulate than senses," he said, as he left. "Wait, only slightly harder?" Ozziel muttered, worried, as he watched the Illusionist disappear into the crowds of Hexam.</Italian>
		<Spanish>Two men, one young, tall, and handsome, the other short, fat, and balding, sat across from each other on the patio of Hexam's finest pub. The place's other patrons, an old man who sat watching the setting sun, two women who sat giggling and exchanging flirtations, and one of the best looking whores Hexam had ever seen, paid them no mind. The Horned Rooster's decorations were tastefully gaudy (insofar as such a thing could exist) and its drinks generally had no more effects than those advertised. Its patio overlooked the finest beach in the Balseraph Empire. But the two sitting at a table by the patio's edge had come together to do more than contemplate the oceans, or ogle those on its beach.

		The younger said, "the problem is simply that nobody has a firm definition of what an illusion is. Any time somebody offers a firm definition, they discover that something they believed was real is, by their own definition, an illusion. Or confess that my creations are not illusions. If you don't believe me, Ozziel, then try me." The elder, Ozziel, said "very well, Nojah. An illusion is something which is not real, but takes on the appearance of being real." Nojah laughed, and said, "oh, come. I'd expected better of you! Define real, then!" Ozziel sighed and looked into his glass. He'd not had anything to drink but strawberry wine, and in small amounts, as he'd been warned dealing with Nojah would test one's wits to their very ends. Ozziel said, "something is real if it has a distinct effect upon the world around it, and is effected by the world around it." Nojah said, "then say I create an illusory Balor, and set it loose amongst some Bannor. Would the creature not have a 'distinct effect?' And I am perfectly capable of enchanting it to bleed should it meet steel, thus fulfilling the requirement that it be effected by the world around it."

Hordes of barbarians await these new civilizations. Wild animals stalk hapless scouts and reckless emissaries. Giant spiders lie in patient wait in the jungles and the forests waiting for their prey to take that last, fatal, step." - Fall from Heaven II on Civfanatics</English>

		<English>"How does one capture the essence of a people on canvas?" Shemun pointed to a series of paintings leaning against the wall of the college entryhall. All recent works of himself, all showing either great vistas of desert or the great malakim trading city of Timberling. "I spent 2 years among the desert people Cashiel and tried to commit my impressions to canvas and in many respects I succeeded. Here you can see the hustle and bustle of the great basar of Timberling with it´s multitude of traders from all over Erebus bartering for both mundane and exotic goods. The painting over there shows the twin harbours of the city, the always busy trade harbor with it´s dozens of craft competing for the best anchorage and the war harbour which only opens its floodgates in times of war. On this one you can see the sun reflecting of the main barracks of the radiant guard and the entrance to the great hall of empyrean with its lavish fountains and beautiful marble statues. But what really defines the desert people I could not paint. I only once caught a glimpse of it when I was visiting an oasis famed for it´s incredibly sweet dates. Imagine you are riding on a docile camel in the sweltering heat of the late afternoon desert. Your mouth is dry and you are looking forward to the caravanserei in which you will spend the night and a cool jug of sweet wine. Then you become aware of a rumbling sound slowly becoming louder. You search the horizons for Thunderclouds. There! You find it. It is low to the ground and quickly coming closer, the continuous sound of thunder steadily growing louder. You try to make sense of the cloud seemingly coming right at you at enormous speed and then a few seconds before it envelops you you can see the riders in sand coloured robes on their camels. Then all is chaos and you can see only sand, heavily armed riders and their camels, the dust makes you blink and the sand invades your clothes your mouth and your nose. All you can do is pray that no one hits you as you sit there on your immobile camel and the raiders pass by in front and behind. And then as suddendly as they appeared they dissapear behind the next dune and all that remains is that rumbling sound slowly growing fainter and a feeling of profound gratefulness that you were not their target today."

		<English>"Believe me lad you don´t want to go to one of those ancient elven forests." Shamun looked at the old mercenary who had sat down opposite him questioningly. "You don´t wanna go there lad cause it won´t be like in the songs and pictures for you. I know the elves write poems and paint pictures that all show how beautiful and peaceful their forests are and those songs and pictures make you wanna go there yourself, paint a picture yourself, feel the serenity and peace, write a poem about it, maybe get lucky with a nymph or dryad while you are there. All nice cozy and safe yes?"

The old mercenary took a long swig from his jug and set it down with a sigh, then he continued in a quieter voice. "You lad will find none of those things there. I grant you there probably is harmony, peace, unicorns and rainbows and all kinds of other nice stuff there but not for the likes of you and me. We don´t belong there. You´d be an intruder and the forest would make you feel it. When you walk the forest you will always feel like distubing the order of the place. When you see small beasts they will run and hide. When you hear birdsong you will know they are talking about you telling the others you are coming. And should you actually manage to find something like a unicorn you should consider yourself lucky if it doesn´t run you through on the spot.

But the worst.... the worst are the trees themselves. Even if you learn to be careful in there in time you have to sleep lad. And in there it is quite possible to bed your head down on solid ground only to wake up hours later and find roots strangling you. Don´t go there lad, don´t intrude, just stay in the city and paint what your imagination shows you. It´ll be closer to what the forests are for those who live in them and it´ll be much safer for you."

-Advice given to Shemun, Dural Master Painter by Verain a Grigori Mercenary</Italian>
		<Spanish>"Believe me lad you don´t want to go to one of those ancient elven forests." Shamun looked at the old mercenary who had sat down opposite him questioningly. "You don´t wanna go there lad cause it won´t be like in the songs and pictures for you. I know the elves write poems and paint pictures that all show how beautiful and peaceful their forests are and those songs and pictures make you wanna go there yourself, paint a picture yourself, feel the serenity and peace, write a poem about it, maybe get lucky with a nymph or dryad while you are there. All nice cozy and safe yes?"

The old mercenary took a long swig from his jug and set it down with a sigh, then he continued in a quieter voice. "You lad will find none of those things there. I grant you there probably is harmony, peace, unicorns and rainbows and all kinds of other nice stuff there but not for the likes of you and me. We don´t belong there. You´d be an intruder and the forest would make you feel it. When you walk the forest you will always feel like distubing the order of the place. When you see small beasts they will run and hide. When you hear birdsong you will know they are talking about you telling the others you are coming. And should you actually manage to find something like a unicorn you should consider yourself lucky if it doesn´t run you through on the spot.

But the worst.... the worst are the trees themselves. Even if you learn to be careful in there in time you have to sleep lad. And in there it is quite possible to bed your head down on solid ground only to wake up hours later and find roots strangling you. Don´t go there lad, don´t intrude, just stay in the city and paint what your imagination shows you. It´ll be closer to what the forests are for those who live in them and it´ll be much safer for you."

		<English>"Yes you are right on first glance it seems odd, maybe even a little hypocritical of me, but let me explain. Elijah Arnauld a very wealthy Calabim governor and holder of the slave trade monopoly within the Calabim nation heard of the portrait I did of Captain Ostanes the famous Hippus mercenary captain. Supposedly he even travelled here incognito to see the painting in our art museum and he resolved that he would have one made of himself. So he sent me letter after letter petitioning me to visit his estates and paint him in oil. He even went so far as to suggest background pose and composition to me. I of course refused not only because I was concerned for my safety but also because I still believe myself to posess some artistic integrity. That did not stop him however and when his petitions did not bear fruit he started to threaten first me and then people close to me.

Finally one of my students stopped showing up for his lessons and a few days later I got a letter telling me to come to Nubia to buy my student back for the very low price of one small portrait. I was afraid of course and did not want to go. I would like to tell you that seeing that my students life was in danger I immediatly made travel arrangements, but I did not. I am not a hero I am a painter. But the students family was a powerful one and they began to apply pressure to for me to go and accept the deal. Finally it got so bad here, that I thought Nubia could not be that much worse and I went. I was terribly wrong but that is a tale for another time.

I met Elijah Arnauld in his slave pens where he was sparring with my student always drawing a little blood. From the scarring he must have been doing this ever since he kidnapped my pupil and I am sure had I not come someday my pupil would have died as the consequence of a tragic "mistake". We struck a deal then. I would paint his likeness in any garment and pose I desired and he would let my student go upon completion of the painting. It took me 2 months in the slavepens of Nubia where he insisted on holding our session to capture his likeness on canvas. The flawless features and alabaster skin without a single blemish were complete in the first weeks the rest of the time I kept working on the details.

If you look closely you can see his writhing victims in the way his robe falls. You can see their tormented faces in the background in the bark of the trees and in the clouds overhead. It took me two months to capture all the suffering I could that surrounded him. Then I declared the picture finished and showed it to him. To my astonishment he was delighted with the painting. And seeing my astonishment he told me in that eerily quiet musical voice of his: "Ultimate beauty my dear genius can only be made tangible by contrasting it with ultimate horror." Well I podered this a long time and I think he was right. That is why I placed his portrait next to the painting of Saint Lessa the Leper."

		<English>Verlain looked at the conscripts and farmboys that had been put under his command. Faces to young to shave and too old for a full set of teeth looked back exited and nervous. His small unit had been stationed about 200 yards behind the main battle line that consisted mainly of Bannor heavy infantry interspersed with groups of elven sword-dancers. At the flanks of the armies formation were large units of elven longbowmen, like furled wings hidden behind the main body but ready to swoop out as soon as the enemy was in sight. But closest to him and his primary responsibilty were the Bannor priests and Elven mages standing by to support the infantry with magic and miracles. His small unit like a few others had been given the task of protecting the spellcasters from dwarfen stragglers that might break through the main line.

Aaron the lord who had hired him came riding over to Verlain just as the first dwarven columns came in sight in the mouth of the pass. Line after line of heavily armored and armed dwarves marched in orderly fashion and accompanied by the sound of drums and blowpipes began to form in battle array facing the allied army positioned on the top of a gentle rise. "How are my boys Verlain?" Lord Aaron asked him gaily. "Nervous and a bit too excited my lord, i fear some of them will be severly disappointed when they discover that war is more about pain and blood then about honor and glory. But else they seem steady." Verlain keept looking at the dwarven army while he talked with his employer and saw a great horde of big fat boars being herded in the woods that framed the valley. "Today should not be that bad my gloomy friend. The dwarves have only infantry and some war machines, which they can´t deploy due to the rugged terrain. Our archers and mages will thin out their charge and then our infantry will hack the survivors to bits. We will eat those big fat boars at the victory feast tonight Verlain." Aaron said inclinig his head towards the boars and shepards entering the woods.

The battle began as planned the dwarves advancing uphill, the archers peppering them with arrows and Verlain kept close to the mages calling down lightning on the dwarven ranks. Verlain kept his boys in loose formation a couple score yards behind the battle line close to the mages and priests. But when the dwarves had covered half the distance towards the defenders three long clear horncalls rang out from the dwarfen lines. Suddendly the fringes of the forests framing the valley were no longer empty. Hundreds of those gigantic boars the dwarves had herded into the trees charged right for the archers and the priests and spellcasters and each of those boars carried a dwarf. A few yards before they clashed into the armies flanks the boars slowed down for a few paces and their riders jumped off charging on behind the boars. Even while frantically reorganizing his men Verlain saw dwarf and boar mercilessly gutting file after file of archers. The Boar riders coming for the mages had were now riding through a hastiliy conjured Thunderstorm that did not seem to slow them much and Verlain made ready to meet their charge. Then a sudden pain exploded in his temple and he fell to the ground loosing consciousness.

He woke to a blinding headache and the smell of roasted boar. A leather clad, dark bearded and rather dirty dwarf stared into his eyes. "Glad am you fine" he said in atrocious common. His speech guttural and thick. "Dead man no ransom. But you fine armour be great commander yes?" Verlain grunted and pain shot through his head again then he tried to speak "I am no great commander but I have some savings. You will get your ransom." The dwarf grinned: "That good enough. You hungry? Killed my riding beast in battle but taste good yes? Not so fine as horse for riding, not so fast, perhaps not so beautiful." The dwarf grinned. "But easy hiding and much better tasting yes?"

Hundreds of those gigantic boars the dwarves had herded into the trees charged right for the archers and the priests and spellcasters and each of those boars carried a dwarf. A few yards before they clashed into the armies flanks the boars slowed down for a few paces and their riders jumped off charging on behind the boars. Even while frantically reorganizing his men Verlain saw dwarf and boar mercilessly gutting file after file of archers. The Boar riders coming for the mages had were now riding through a hastiliy conjured Thunderstorm that did not seem to slow them much and Verlain made ready to meet their charge. Then a sudden pain exploded in his temple and he fell to the ground loosing consciousness.

He woke to a blinding headache and the smell of roasted boar. A leather clad, dark bearded and rather dirty dwarf stared into his eyes. "Glad am you fine" he said in atrocious common. His speech guttural and thick. "Dead man no ransom. But you fine armour be great commander yes?" Verlain grunted and pain shot through his head again then he tried to speak "I am no great commander but I have some savings. You will get your ransom." The dwarf grinned: "That good enough. You hungry? Killed my riding beast in battle but taste good yes? Not so fine as horse for riding, not so fast, perhaps not so beautiful." The dwarf grinned. "But easy hiding and much better tasting yes?"

		<English>So what is the key to winning a battle by magical means? Sure we all know how to invoke fire upon our enemies. We are all familiar with the forces of air and lightning. But all the fire we can call will avail us little if the enemy is hidden behind stout fortress walls and lightning from the skies won´t bother dwarves hiding in caves much. I therefore propose a different approach. In casting our combat spells we select certain properties of Erebus and exert our will to concentrate those properties on the point of effect. When casting a fireball spell for example we concentrate a lot of heat energy in a single place. But, all that energy does not come from within us. It can not. Not even the most powerful archmage would be able to keep that much power inside of him for a significant amount of time. So we reach out along the threads of the fabric of reality to gather the power we need and relocate some small threads from here and there to achieve our desired effect.

I now propose an inverted approach. With a comparable amount of effort we should be able to reach out along the fabric and weaken not just the threads corresponding to certain elements but simply all the threads of reality in a certain place. Doing that should create a temporary instability in the veil that seperates our world from the the realms of deamons and angels. Such an instability would, so I believe, lead to a ripple effect spreading outwards along the strongest ley lines present in the area and distribute anything standing close to the instabilty to random locations in the immediate vicinity. And dear collegues this would not be a gentle means of relocation.

While I believe that great care must be taken not to create a permanent doorway thusly allowing beings outside of our reality to step through, it would allow us to greatly disatvantage any well dug in defender and make them vulnerable to elimination by more direct applications of combat wizardry.

		<English>To see the world one must travel it, that much is true. But how to decide what is worth seeing? How to judge if the gain is worth the risk? You could spend many an evening in roadside taverns listening to travellers tales, but most likely you will learn more about the prices of wool and pork in Kwythellar than about the cosmopolitan air of its broad collonaded streets and the dazzling variety its proud walls hold. You can walk the docks talking to sailors just in from their journeys to the Amurite islands. But most likely you will hear more tales, most likely fabricated ones, about enormous sea monsters and magical nights of pleasure, than about the wonders of magically supplemented architecture and the miracles of weather control magic the amurites use so well. You could even visit the barracks and talk to our grizzled veterans, men who have seen many a corner of erebus. You will mostly hear about Ljosalfar women and the wines of the Elohim not about the breathtaking sight of Cahir Abbey its terraced Vineyards and flowergardens filling the whole vista. So how are you to know where to go if you are neither soldier nor trader nor sailor?

Come to our fine art gallery my friend! Here you can see for yourself the majesty of Cahir Abbey, the madness and gaity of a belseraph carneval, the mysterious shadows of the sidar capital of Celo, Doviello hunting rituals and even the torments suffered by the souls of the damned near Dis.

		<English>The sun was comfortably warm on Sorahs back as she was lying beside Joltuk, one of the best scouts of her small band of Austrin hunters and explorers. " Seems the long winter is truly gone for good." Joltuk grunted as she removed her wolf fur coat. She looked down on her friend since childhood and grinned mischieviously: "Aren´t you supposed to watch their camp and not lust after every bit of flesh you see?" "I can´t help it when you present yourself so appealingly, besides we´ve been watching them for weeks and seen nothing interesting so far." You may not have my ogrish friend but your focus seems somewhat narrow to me. I think they have a lot of promise." "Not their women, they don´t." Sorah grinned: "Since you are useless as a scout today go tell the others to get ready to move." And she started planning her approach.

In the ghostlight of the new dawn they easily penetratet the camps peremiter. While her best archers took up position above the camp those preferring close combat moved to block the main paths. Making contact was always the most dangerous part of her mission and she had learned to be careful. She herself went to the tall Pine growing in the center of the camp, the hulking form of Joltuk spear in hand at her side. There she put her hands on her hips and called in cheerful old patrian: "Good morning fellow people of Erebus. Please do not be alarmed! We come armed but we don´t come to fight. Quite the opposite indeed. We come to discuss the possibility of an alliance. You preserved crafts and traditions from before the age of ice and we would see you flourish in this new age of growth at our side. So let your leader come forward so we may discuss our proposal."

Days later Joltuk and Sorah were leaving, while the rest of the band stayed to protect their new allies. "Well now the real works begins old friend. Go back to request reinforcements and then back here, tame the surrounding area and find other small tribes to supplement their numbers." "And I was so looking forward to spending a summer alone with you at some lakeside." "Well I think we can find some small lake somewhere along our path, and one or two days of rest can´t hurt." Joltuk chuckled. "It´s a deal. Those two days belong to me my dear girl, after that I belong to you again o great commander."</English>

Your domains have been invaded by axe and by flame,
our armies dead our arrows useless our swords drawn in vain.
Great pathways were cut and armies of torches come,
to burn our homes and we can only run.

Taste the ashes that fall with the rain,
those are the trees that won´t bloom again.
Drink in the blood that soaks all our land,
those are our warriors who failed to defend.

Nothing is left now but you, elder brothers,
you have to stir now to save all the others,
every birch, pine and oak now still saplings,
those who live in their shadows no matter their trappings.

Feel the rage of the defiled!

Feel the pain of the lost!

Feel the fury of the bereaved!

Feel my old friends!
Quicken your heartbeats!
Tear out your roots!
And march!

those are our warriors who failed to defend.

Nothing is left now but you, elder brothers,
you have to stir now to save all the others,
every birch, pine and oak now still saplings,
those who live in their shadows no matter their trappings.

Feel the rage of the defiled!

Feel the pain of the lost!

Feel the fury of the bereaved!

Feel my old friends!
Quicken your heartbeats!
Tear out your roots!
And march!

- Last prayer of Ellianthelain, Elven high priest of Hyll before the great burning</Italian>
		<Spanish>Hear my call ancients, eternal guardians of the holy glades!

Your domains have been invaded by axe and by flame,
our armies dead our arrows useless our swords drawn in vain.
Great pathways were cut and armies of torches come,
to burn our homes and we can only run.

Taste the ashes that fall with the rain,
those are the trees that won´t bloom again.
Drink in the blood that soaks all our land,
those are our warriors who failed to defend.

Nothing is left now but you, elder brothers,
you have to stir now to save all the others,
every birch, pine and oak now still saplings,
those who live in their shadows no matter their trappings.

Feel the rage of the defiled!

Feel the pain of the lost!

Feel the fury of the bereaved!

Feel my old friends!
Quicken your heartbeats!
Tear out your roots!
And march!

		<English>"I won´t go! I am not your damn puppet!" Verlain almost shouted. "We are all puppets to one another my dear", the Mage grinned. "Whatever you say you crazy biddy, but I won´t sneak into the forest to see if the elves are still there. One arrow is all that it takes you know." Verlain answered grimly. "Yes you refuse to jump although I pulled your strings." Her makeup that had made her look like a tavern harlot had run in the rain now making her look more like a sad clown. "But I hold only a few of yours so no wonder. Money, flesh, companionship are all puppet strings, but like all strings they are fragile.easily torn if too much pressure is applied. Especially if the other puppeteers jerk the other way." "What other puppeteers? I am a mercenary. I am Grigori. I serve no gods and I work for myself." "Yes puppet sure you do, but why? No sometimes holding some strings of the whole just is not enough." She turned away and started to rummage in her ridiculously large lugagge. "Sometimes if no puppet will do as you ask, it is time to bring a new player on the stage, one fashioned especially for one scene." As she turned back her hair that had been wet and plastered to her head before looked all wiry and was standing off in all directions also her makeup now amplified the impact of her startling blue and green eyes. "Stalker", she said to the small greenclad doll in her hands "You will not refuse my like this nasty big brute of a man has will you?" Verlain looket at the Mage with her doll and saw the doll stare back at him with jealosy and horror. "You will go into the forest over there and see if the nasty elves are still there, will you not my sweet?" The puppet jumped from her hands and started to walk towards the forest, but the mage stopped it. "Before you go take this knife my sweet, so you can defend yourself if they still lurk there." Verlain watched horrified as the small doll ran towards the forest big meat knife in hand while beside him the mage cackled insanely moving her hands in jerky motions.

		<English>Shemun stood on a before his scafolld, brush in hand, seemingly forgotten. He had finally gotten permission from the elven court to visit the ancient city of Evermore, and now he stood on a meadow outside the walls. In front of him a pond fed by a sparkling waterfall, the colors of the rainbow dancing between the cascades of water. The spring sun warmed the ground and most of the flowers and trees were in full bloom. He could see deer between the blossoming birch trees and a pair of foxes playing not far away while melodious birdsong filled his ears. He had come here to paint the beauty of the elven realm but he just watched. He did not even see the landscape, all he had eyes for was a beautiful elven maiden walking the meadow. She stopped by every tree she passed leaning her slender bdoy against the bark seemingly listening. From time to time birds would descend from their nests, perch on her shoulder and sing in her ears. Following her closely but never intruding, never startling the brids or other small animals that came to her were a pair of wildcats, seemingly guarding her and occasionally glancing towards Shemun. He had even once seen a unicorn appear far back in the trees also observing the elven woman, but it had been gone so fast he now was no longer sure he had even seen it. And if the activity around her was fascinating she herself was truly captivating. She was undoubtetly beautiful, although not as perfect as some of the Scion women Shemun had seen on his visit to Patria a year before. But she had an aura of vitality and harmony that seemed to radiate out from her making everything she came close too appear more alive. And she had an air of innocence that made his instincts scream to protect her. He was so lost in observing her that he did not even notice that she came towards him until she spoke.

"You should paint this now master artist. You might not get another chance." It took several seconds before Shemun had collected enough conscious thought to stammer an answer. "Wha.... What do you mean by that?" The maiden looked at him and suddendly he saw sadness in her eyes. "The birds tell me of great factories in the lands of the Khazad and the Dural burning scores of trees each day, they say there is nary a tree left there to nest. They also tell me of great fleets of ships being built in the Kingdom of the Lanun, that they fell many a tree only take the strongest of the wood and burn the rest. The badgers tell me that the blight left the fields of the Bannor in the north barren, they say that even field mice find it hard to survive there. And the trees themselves tell me that great clouds of poisons are being carried towards us every summer across the mountains to our west originating from the labs of the Sheaim." Shemus just stared at her while she talked. "When i was still a baby Sheaim pyre-zombies burned the village and the forests my parents lived in. While the Sheaim were slaughtering the villagers I crawled out into the forest and hid from the blaze in a badgers den. The animals cared for me and I learned to talk to them and to the trees before I ever learned to talk to other elves or even humans like yourself. They protected me and now I owe it to them to protect them. We are surrounded by nations that covet our woods, without thought for badger, deer and bear gentle painter. But we will no longer quietly fall back from their axes and saws. We will stand and fight whatever way we can, whatever way we have to." She looked up at the sky at some clouds that now seemed to Shemun to have a slight greenish cast to them. "I just hope it will be enough."

As she turned and walked away Shemun felt the forest becoming a bit colder, a bit darker. He took a piece of charcoal and a sketchpad from his backpack and started sketching to capture what he saw.

		<English>"Bah this is rotten!" Verlain said spitting out a morsel of whatever he had just put in his mouth seconds before. "Isss not rotten, isss presserved gorilla liver, keepss for yearss." the mazatl quartermaster that had been distributing the rations answered indignantly. "I can believe that this stuff won´t get any worse over the years cause not even a maggot would be caught dead eating it!. What did you do to it? Never heard of salting or drying?". The quartermaster looked at Verlain with contempt:"Drying iss no good in the sswampss. It will only get wet again alsso dry meat iss bad for your humourss. And ass for ssalting, ssalting iss even worsse. Ssalted food makess you ssluggish and ssluggish warriorss die. A warrior needss hiss blood quick and hiss mind nimble, and sso we prepare your rationss acordingly." Verlain looked sceptical:"To feed soldiers bad food to keep them in a bad mood i can understand, to feed them little to inspire them to loot also, but to feed them this..... It makes you want to murder the one who prepared it!" The small Mazatl looked indignant:"Only our besst hunterss are allowed to procure meat for our foreign mercenaries. Also great care is taking in the preparation. Firsst we drain the blood from the meat ass far ass is posssible. Then we put the meat in a jar and roast it slowly for several hourss, after that it is marinated in the presservative sauce. This sauce too iss mosst difficult to procure. It is the urine of panthers that hass been left out in the ssun to concentrate the quick essence of the beast and when itss conssisstency iss......" The quatermaster broke off his explanation and looked astonished at the mercenary who was trying to void his belly as best as he could. When Verlain finally could speak again he faced the quartermaster squarely and said:"From now on I will only eat imported salted meat and bread. I don´t care about maggots and I don´t care how hard the bread is but if you can´t feed me properly I will quit my contract tomorrow."

"I can believe that this stuff won´t get any worse over the years cause not even a maggot would be caught dead eating it!. What did you do to it? Never heard of salting or drying?". The quartermaster looked at Verlain with contempt:"Drying iss no good in the sswampss. It will only get wet again alsso dry meat iss bad for your humourss. And ass for ssalting, ssalting iss even worsse. Ssalted food makess you ssluggish and ssluggish warriorss die. A warrior needss hiss blood quick and hiss mind nimble, and sso we prepare your rationss acordingly." Verlain looked sceptical:"To feed soldiers bad food to keep them in a bad mood i can understand, to feed them little to inspire them to loot also, but to feed them this..... It makes you want to murder the one who prepared it!" The small Mazatl looked indignant:"Only our besst hunterss are allowed to procure meat for our foreign mercenaries. Also great care is taking in the preparation. Firsst we drain the blood from the meat ass far ass is posssible. Then we put the meat in a jar and roast it slowly for several hourss, after that it is marinated in the presservative sauce. This sauce too iss mosst difficult to procure. It is the urine of panthers that hass been left out in the ssun to concentrate the quick essence of the beast and when itss conssisstency iss......" The quatermaster broke off his explanation and looked astonished at the mercenary who was trying to void his belly as best as he could. When Verlain finally could speak again he faced the quartermaster squarely and said:"From now on I will only eat imported salted meat and bread. I don´t care about maggots and I don´t care how hard the bread is but if you can´t feed me properly I will quit my contract tomorrow."

		<English>Strife in itself is an integral part of life. We all struggle all of the time although our trials are very different. Some may struggle to keep food on the table, some to keep their families and friends safe and other might struggle against the unrelenting boredom that threatens to smother their lives. Struggle in itself is nothing to be avoided but to be unified and directed. For when a people as a whole focus their attentions on a single goal and use all their ingenuity, energy and skill to achieve it, it is a mighty struggle ideed. But thus harmony is born. Harmony does not exist by itself it needs discord strife and hardships to be able to manifest. Just as sound by itself is not music but pluck the right notes out of a sea of noise and you hear a chord to make angels weep.

		<English>* The principle itself is simple *

Kalley was hiding in some bushes not farm from a farmstead listening to the mind voice of his instructor, watching the small family go about their business. The sun had just set and father and sun were repairing some fences in the fields while the mother and her two daughters were preparing supper from time to time a giggling infant could be heard whether boy or girl Kalley did not know but neither did he care.

* Clear your thoughts of distractions and place the wretch beside you *

Kalley had been told to fetch one of the many torture victims from the guilds dungeons. His teachers had insisted that he bring a broken man with him for this field test, now he would get to know why. He picked up the gagged wreck of a man and put him against the rough bark of a tree nearby. The bark opened some of the many wounds on the mans back but he did not resist. The wretch whimpering into his gag beside him disgusted Kalley but he soon found his center and became calm and ready to channel the flow of energies.

* In order to project despair convincingly true despair must be felt *

Kalley understood then. A mage despairing was a mage unable to focus and unable to cast so the feeling he wanted to project would by it´s very nature render him unable to use his powers. That was why they had told him to bring the wretch along.

* Now reach out to his thoughts and project his feelings at your target *

Kalleys brow furrowed in concentration as he put his left hand, the hand that absorbs, on the mans forehead. Then he slowly started to build a connection between the man and the cottage and as soon as he felt it was stable enough he began to channel emotion through it.

* Anchor the flow with the crystal we gave you *

Kalley took out a crystal the color of dried blood and concentrated on weaving the lines of power into it´s essence. That was never easy with entropy crystals but he had been practicing for two years now and it took him hardly more than an hour until he felt the slow draining of his power ease. The crystal now pulsated darkly and he knew that it would sustain the spell for at least a day.

* Observe the results of your spell *

Kalley looked at the small cottage but could see no movement so he slowly and silently went towards the window where some light could be seen. He could hear no sound but soft crying and sobbing from the small house. As he looked in throgh the window he saw the whole family sitting at their supper but no one was eating anymore. They were all sitting around the table motionless despair and desolation on their faces. The only sounds and movement came from the infant futilely trying to get a reaction from its mother. The light came from the hearth where a small fire still flickered it´s embers glowing red and Kalley thought, full of hunger.

* Move some of the embers into the bedding and observe *

Kalley used a small push of his telekinetic powers to move one of the embers into the bedding straw. And saw it catch fire almost immediately. He had always liked fire and seeing things burn so he stood at the window watching as the flames began to consume the small cottage. The family still did not move. They had turned to look at the fire and the father had begun to stand up, but resignation and despair had won out and he had sat down again. Only the baby wailed loudly as the flames came closer. Kalley began to walk away and his footsteps were accompanied by the screams of the burning family and the roar of the hungry flames.

* Now you understand. Tomorrow you will join the others. Adept. *

Kalley looked at the small cottage but could see no movement so he slowly and silently went towards the window where some light could be seen. He could hear no sound but soft crying and sobbing from the small house. As he looked in throgh the window he saw the whole family sitting at their supper but no one was eating anymore. They were all sitting around the table motionless despair and desolation on their faces. The only sounds and movement came from the infant futilely trying to get a reaction from its mother. The light came from the hearth where a small fire still flickered it´s embers glowing red and Kalley thought, full of hunger.

* Move some of the embers into the bedding and observe *

Kalley used a small push of his telekinetic powers to move one of the embers into the bedding straw. And saw it catch fire almost immediately. He had always liked fire and seeing things burn so he stood at the window watching as the flames began to consume the small cottage. The family still did not move. They had turned to look at the fire and the father had begun to stand up, but resignation and despair had won out and he had sat down again. Only the baby wailed loudly as the flames came closer. Kalley began to walk away and his footsteps were accompanied by the screams of the burning family and the roar of the hungry flames.

* Now you understand. Tomorrow you will join the others. Adept. *

		<English>Lore:

The walls are high the soldiers brave,
the knights are proud the arrows true,
they charge our walls wave after wave,
they say they´ve won, if they only knew.

In our dreams we leave this place,
In our dreams we spread the fear,
In our dreams we call the darkness,
In our dreams our lords are near!

We cower here inside our fortress,
no relief is on it´s way
they say they´re light and we are darkness,
to cleanse the taint they´ve come they say.

In our dreams we leave this place,
In our dreams we spread the fear,
In our dreams we call the darkness,
In our dreams our lords are near!

At day they fight and we must fear them,
but as night falls our turn is come,
our thoughts take shape and walk amongst them,
hear the music, hear them run!

In our dreams we leave this place,
In our dreams we spread the fear,
In our dreams we call the darkness,
In our dreams our lords are near!

Dream brothers! Dream!

		<English>Verlain looked down at the great city of Kingsport and felt despair. Hundreds of sails could be seen in its harbor and dozens more out at sea. As if that was not enough he could spot 3 trading caravans trundling to the hills wagons heavily laden with exotic goods and each of those was at least fifty people and more than a hundred animals strong.

"We should have caught him in the hills, we will never find him here. And if he manages to leave the city it will take us weeks to pick up his trace again." The greyclad ranger beside him also looked at the city pensively then said without looking at Verlain "Should and would are words of smoke. We did not and he is here. He must not escape us or the shadow masters would be wroth with us." Verlain grimaced. "It´s just that I don´t care for dodging your masters´ asassins for the remainder of my days they don´t take kindly to failure Saraphan." The ranger let out a strange hissing sound and studied Verlain from the shadows of his hood. "No need to tell me of my masters Verlain, just see to it that no one disturbs my concentration as I ride." Then the flapping of dark wings could be heard, as a big raven landed on his shoulder and the ranger stiffened and closed his eyes. Then the raven took wing again and flew out towards the harbour.

Verlain had to concentrate to here Saraphans whispering voice. "Sails and more sails, sailors and cargo, shipmasters, timbers, barrels of water, dockside whores, shipmasters, captains and cabin boys, barrels full of rum and crates full of spices, beggars and cripples but no sign of our black pray." Verlain had lost sight of the raven out over the harbour but the ranger whispered on. "Five and twenty ships already left today" then followed a short pause and Verlain thought he could see a black shadow flying out to see following the ships that had already left. "Beautiful serpent bound for Tyll, cargo of spices and wool, Shining handmaiden, a galley bound for Elven lands with a cargo of wine and leathers,....." and so it went on a list of ships and destinations that seemed to be all over Erebus. Verlain saw sweat trickling down then rangers face. "Then the raven seemed to fly over land. "Four and sixty camels bound for Lodente, two and twenty mules bound for the underhome with twenty dwarves and one human." The rangers voice grew more intent. "Clad in darkness, his face hooded always hiding between mules, going towards a tunnel entrance, a crossbow!" Saraphan screamed in agony, clutched his chest and then seemed to shudder. Verlain stepped closer and shook him by the shoulder shouting "Come to man! Come to! I need to know what´s happening!" Saraphan opened his eyes and looked around obviosly disoriented, then he took a deep breath and started to run. "He killed Fogrider and he is about to enter the dwarven tunnels! Come we must make haste Verlain!"

As Verlain made to follow the ranger he muttered "Dwarves, why does it have to be bloody dwarves?"

		<English>Shemun was unhurriedly strolling through the streets of Hardshire, a Bannor trading city situated on the gulf of flame. To look at the city one would hardly have guessed this to be a center of the dye trade. The piers were rather small few ships were to be seen and hardly a merchant stall in sight. This was a city of banks and branch offices. Its inhabitants were well dressed men and women going about their business quietly. There were no warehouses and few wares on display. This was the nervecenter of the dye trade but few of the dyes bought and sold here ever saw the city.

Soon Shemun had reached his destination and knocked on the unremarkle door of a well to do but by no means ostentatious house he knew to be the residence and offices of Alkar Loomhand one of the foremost traders of the city. The door was opened only seconds later and he was ushered in by a middle age serving woman. "Please be kind enough to wait in the salon young master." She said gesturing towars the door on his right. "The master is talking to one of his other clients but he will soon have time for you. I will bring you some refreshments, please make yourself comfortable."

The salon was a comfortable room tastefully furnished, but Shemun allowed that he might be prejudiced since two of the paintings on the wall were of his own make. He did not have to wait long, his cup of tea was still too hot to drink when Master Alkar entered the room and smiled at him as soon as he saw him. Alkar was a painfully thin man with a balding head and a carefully trimmed grey beard. "Always a pleasure to see you my young friend", he said while shaking Shamuns hand. "You know how much I admire your genius so have you come to buy or sell my friend?"
"I was hoping for a trade Alkar. I am afraid I would not be able to pay in coin for what I need." Alkar smiled. "Another one of your exotic paint ingredients eh? Well you are lucky then that I need a new painting for my daughters room. So what is it you need?" Shemun lowered his voice. "I need a very special kind of ink called Razorweed spirit. And as you doubtless know it is impossible to get the stuff via regular channels." The merchant shook his head thoughtfully. "I hope you know what you are doing my friend, what you want is not only hard to get but also highly illegal." Shemun nodded. "I know Alkar. But I simply can´t paint the piece I have been comissioned to paint without it. It just would not look right." The merchant grimaced: "You are in luck then since the 14th Crusader Auxiliaries and the chapter of eternal vigilance have advanced a bit further into unclaimed broken lands last month and I heard they lost some men to razorweed. And as luck would have it I know the commander of the 14th. But...... It will cost you more than just one painting. I am willing to offer my services for one painting of your choice and one I will comission you to do at a later date but the soldiers gathering that hellish stuff for you will want to see some golden coins for their trouble. I think 200 should suffice."

Two hours later Shemun started his journey home. The bargain had cost him dearly but at least he would now be able to finish ascent to Erebus at last.

But I simply can´t paint the piece I have been comissioned to paint without it. It just would not look right." The merchant grimaced: "You are in luck then since the 14th Crusader Auxiliaries and the chapter of eternal vigilance have advanced a bit further into unclaimed broken lands last month and I heard they lost some men to razorweed. And as luck would have it I know the commander of the 14th. But...... It will cost you more than just one painting. I am willing to offer my services for one painting of your choice and one I will comission you to do at a later date but the soldiers gathering that hellish stuff for you will want to see some golden coins for their trouble. I think 200 should suffice."

Two hours later Shemun started his journey home. The bargain had cost him dearly but at least he would now be able to finish ascent to Erebus at last.

-Biography of Shemun, Dural master painter</German>
		<Italian>Shemun was unhurriedly strolling through the streets of Hardshire, a Bannor trading city situated on the gulf of flame. To look at the city one would hardly have guessed this to be a center of the dye trade. The piers were rather small few ships were to be seen and hardly a merchant stall in sight. This was a city of banks and branch offices. Its inhabitants were well dressed men and women going about their business quietly. There were no warehouses and few wares on display. This was the nervecenter of the dye trade but few of the dyes bought and sold here ever saw the city.

Soon Shemun had reached his destination and knocked on the unremarkle door of a well to do but by no means ostentatious house he knew to be the residence and offices of Alkar Loomhand one of the foremost traders of the city. The door was opened only seconds later and he was ushered in by a middle age serving woman. "Please be kind enough to wait in the salon young master." She said gesturing towars the door on his right. "The master is talking to one of his other clients but he will soon have time for you. I will bring you some refreshments, please make yourself comfortable."

The salon was a comfortable room tastefully furnished, but Shemun allowed that he might be prejudiced since two of the paintings on the wall were of his own make. He did not have to wait long, his cup of tea was still too hot to drink when Master Alkar entered the room and smiled at him as soon as he saw him. Alkar was a painfully thin man with a balding head and a carefully trimmed grey beard. "Always a pleasure to see you my young friend", he said while shaking Shamuns hand. "You know how much I admire your genius so have you come to buy or sell my friend?"
"I was hoping for a trade Alkar. I am afraid I would not be able to pay in coin for what I need." Alkar smiled. "Another one of your exotic paint ingredients eh? Well you are lucky then that I need a new painting for my daughters room. So what is it you need?" Shemun lowered his voice. "I need a very special kind of ink called Razorweed spirit. And as you doubtless know it is impossible to get the stuff via regular channels." The merchant shook his head thoughtfully. "I hope you know what you are doing my friend, what you want is not only hard to get but also highly illegal." Shemun nodded. "I know Alkar.

		<English>"Look down there mylord and tell me what you see." The pruple clad official called Ashdor said pointing towards the window. Caladien looked outside at the bustling little market place and said dismissively: "It is just a farmers market. Where people buy and sell the foodstuffs they grow in the fields surrounding the city." "Yes my lord more to the point it is the farmers market where the people from Longvale sell their wheat. During harvesting season dozens of carts come in every day and their grain is sold on this market." "I don´t really grasp your meaning Ashdor. I know the tariffs we get from this market barely justify the expense of keeping tax collectors here and as far as I can see giving away longvale for lasting peace will cost neither the city nor the empire much in the long run." Ashdor sighed. "You are of course right my lord, the tariffs collected here are marginal. But the grain sold here is mostly sold to long distance traders. And we collect further tarrifs at the harbour and at the city gates. Also most of the grain that gets sold here ends up in the bakeries of our capital. So if we were to give away longvale we would suffer a minimal tax hit here a small one at the harbour and at the city gates, but most importantly we would be forced to import grain to keep the supply situation in our capital stable." "You are telling me there will be famine if we give away longvale?" Ashor looked down at the thriving market again: "No my lord not famine. But it would become harder to feed the capital and the army. And if we loose another fertile region in the future then there will be famine. So I urge you to think about this. If I were in your position I would rather give away the coppermines of yellow hills then the wheat fields of longvale."

"I hope you know what you are doing my friend, what you want is not only hard to get but also highly illegal." Shemun nodded. "I know Alkar. But I simply can´t paint the piece I have been comissioned to paint without it. It just would not look right." The merchant grimaced: "You are in luck then since the 14th Crusader Auxiliaries and the chapter of eternal vigilance have advanced a bit further into unclaimed broken lands last month and I heard they lost some men to razorweed. And as luck would have it I know the commander of the 14th. But...... It will cost you more than just one painting. I am willing to offer my services for one painting of your choice and one I will comission you to do at a later date but the soldiers gathering that hellish stuff for you will want to see some golden coins for their trouble. I think 200 should suffice."

Two hours later Shemun started his journey home. The bargain had cost him dearly but at least he would now be able to finish ascent to Erebus at last.

		<English>Saraphans grey form was almost invisble against the mist behind him and amongst the brush and small trees on the hilltop. Still he had a clear view of the dwaven pioneers setting up the small settlement they called Rockhomme on a gentle rise beside the bank of the greenwater. The settlement was very young, a collection of huts with a few hundred dwarves as inhabitants at best and only a green unit of maybe one hundred dwarven slingers as defenders. It was no threat to anyone..... yet. But the elder shades of Celo had decreed that the dwarves had settled to close to Sidar lands and so sent Shaladar and his rangers to raze it. Shaladar had sent out Fogrider, his Raven companion, earlier and had seen nothing to change his assesment that this would not be a difficult task. True the dwarves had built on a hilltop to allow their slingers greater range and slow down attackers but the dense forests that grew around Rockhomme would hide his rangers until they were very close and the gentle slope of the hill would do little to slow his men. The dwarves had also started on building Palisades but those were crude at best and unfinished in many places. Satisfied that tomorrow should be an easy victory Shaladar descended from his Lookout to wait for the arrival of his fellow rangers.

He woke from his shallow dreamless sleep with a start and heard a loud grumbling in the distance. The sound seemed to be coming from the direction of Rockhomme. His men were up and armed as well but no threat materialized. Then other sounds could be heard as he climbed back to the hilltop, water gurgling, stones falling, wood breaking. He reached the summit but could see nothing of Rockhomme. Although it was a clear and cloudless night thick fog seemed to surround the dwarven settlement in all directions. He spent the rest of the night on the hilltop futilely trying to get a glance of what was going on.

As the new dawn came he could see the Fog for what it really was an enormous cloud of dust. But the dust that had risen in the night had already partially settled so he could see the outlines of Rockhomme again and what he saw dismayed him. Gone was the covered approach to the city the trees had fallen for two hundred yards out from the base of the hill and not fallen randomly but in patterns that would slow any approach. Gone also was the gentle rise easy to climb instead the dwarven settlement now stood on a steep cliff. The rock had fallen away to form a dam in the Greenwater on one side and on the other side provided now dams for the new riverbed that formed a moat around the hill. The only dry approach to the settlement was now from the other bank of the greenwater across the dam of fallen stone and out of his reach. The palisades were still unfinished but perched atop steep cliffs this was empty consolation. He shook his head in wonderment and descended to his waiting men.

"We go back. If the Elders still want Rockhomme gone they will have to send an army."

		<English>I´d rather fight an Amurite mage than those Sheaim bastards any day. Sure being burnt to cinders is neither nice nor pleasant and there ain´t much you can do on a battlefield to protect yourself from random lightning strikes, but however they kill you at least it´s quick.

The Sheaim on the other hand...... They like to make you suffer. You ever broke a limb and had to wear a cast my friend? I had one on my leg once and there was always this itching spot right above my ankle that no matter how hard I tried, I just could not scratch. One of their favourite spells is like that only much much worse. I should know, I got hit by it once. The pain was excruciating but not incapacitating. It was not designed to make you lie down and moan in agony, it was designed to make you mad. And the only thing your pain-addled brain can come up with to make it stop is to kill the son of a bitch who laid that spell on you.

So you go charging out of your own positions and into the enemy. You don´t care how many of them there are nor how well entrenched they might be. You just want to strangle the bastard. And all the while, you charge across the field and your comrades are being hacked down around you, you hear his cruel mocking laughter in your head. Taunting you, daring you to get him. I only survived that day because my own captain hamstrung me. Most of my friends were not so lucky.

So I ask you to stand with us now! Yes, I know we are not followers of Lugus or Junil, but we stand against the darkness now while your priests preach about its coming. Alone we will fall. I cannot say if it will be next year or in a decade but without some assistance, from somewhere or someone, we cannot stand against the forces of evil. We need your help esteemed councillors!

I urge you to set aside past grievances and fogive or forget past wrongs. For the past is gone, never to change, but the future is ours to forge! Together we can make the forests of my people into a fortress the darkness can never penetrate! Together we can drive back the demons and the undead that plague our lands. Together we can build an alliance that can vanquish this darkness forever and reestablish the compact our gods agreed upon!

No matter our differences in appearance or custom, when compared to our enemies we are all brothers and sisters to one another. So let us be as one people, as one nation, until we have driven back the night and ensured peace and safety for all our peoples. This is called the age of rebirth, so let the old peace that once reigned between us be reborn now, and to help build a safe and prosperous future for all of us. We come before you as petitioners but we do not come with empty hands. We offer our soldiers and fortresses, we offer our friendship and alliance. All you have to do is accept and step forward together into a bright and valiant future!"

		<English>Akris stumbled through an overgrown riverbed. He was exhausted and shaking with fear. Also filled with shame as he had just lost his first command. The elders of the Chapter of the Burning Rose had entrusted him to lead Astrums levies against a lair of vile undead that haunted the hills north of the city. But Akris himself, just like many of his men had run when the Spectres came wailing towards them. Their cries had been a bonechilling shriek, while their bodies resembled humanoid shadows that flickered in and out of sight as they just passed through trees and boulders that lay before their path. Akris to his shame had broken and ran. He had not stopped running since then and now he had no idea where he was, nor what had happened to his command. The sun had come over the horizon hours ago, when he finally managed to clear his head enough of to stop. He had trouble breathing, his throat felt dry as sandpaper and as he fumbled for his canteen, he realized he had dropped it somewhere during his flight. He spent several hours looking for something, anything to drink, but found only some bitter berries that made his stomach cramp. At least though, it took care of the worst of his thirst, then he set out to find other survivors.

Night had already fallen when he finally heard human voices again. He had drunk from a pond during his wanderings and had even found some nutritious roots along his path. Now he heard voices which were the first sign of survivors he had come across, since he fled the hill. He stopped and listened. They were coming from beyond a hillcrest and the loudest among them was a prayer to Junil. At least a dozen people had joined their voices to a triumphant chorus, thanking Junil for the courage and resolve he had blessed them with, but also asking that he keep his chosen from harm this dark night. He sighed with relief that he did not have to spend the night alone in the forest and went towards the voices.

"Lord of Justice preserve us!
Keep the unclean from us!
We who keep thy order on Erebus,
beseech thee for thy blessings!"

The chorus of voices chanted. And a single voice answered leading them in their prayer.

"We few who have walked through hell and returned,
we vow to stand between the darkness and the light,
to defend those who cannot fight themselves
from all those foes who defy thine holy order!"

He could see fires beyond the hills crest and now also heard moans and the rattle of armor. He could smell food being prepared. But mixed with the appetizig smells were the smells of funeral pyres. Of men burnt to keep them from rising again this night.

"Lord of justice preserve us!
No matter how horrid our foe,
how unequal the odds we shall stand,
to defend your will and your order!"

Akris had crested the hill and saw maybe fifty survivors on top of an old burial mound around a big blazing fire. A cleric of Junil was leading the prayer of those well enough to pray, while in the flickering shadows the big fire cast many lay wounded or despairing. There were sentries too, but these were not Bannor soldiers, but ghostly figures glowing softly in the darkness. Akris had heard of such spirits but never seen them, they were the ghosts of fallen heroes, no doubt buried at this ancient site and they obviously had agreed to defend the ragged band that had sought shelter here. He stumbled into the camp helped by two of the silent glowing sentinels, and after a night and a day of fear he finally felt safe again.

"We beseech you Lord do not judge us harshly,
for we are but mortal men and mortal flesh.
And though law and order are unyielding and unbending,
we are weak without your help.

So keep from us death and darkness this night,
for we have already been tried sorely.
Keep from us the unliving and the undying
for thy will is our law and thy mercy our salvation."

Those were the last words Akris heard before he fell into a blissfully, unfeeling unconsciousness. He woke some time later, it was still night and found the cleric sitting beside him. He was an older man, his hair graying and his forehead and well trimmed beard gave his face a stern cast. But the wrinkles around his eyes suggested humor and compassion. "You have been sorely tried my son but you are safe here. I beseeched Junil for protection and he sent these heroes of a past age to be our guards and sentinels tonight. We have managed to put some food together and not far from here is a spring of clear cold water, so you will be able to regain some strength before we withdraw fully tomorrow." Akris looked around the camp and not much had changed since he had arrived, so he guessed that he had not been unconscious for long. "Follow me my son I will lead you to the spring and then we will see that you get something to eat."

They left the silent sentinels behind them and followed a path down the hillside. While they talked about the attack and how to best find the other bands of survivors, they suspected scattered in these dark forests. The forest was quiet and the gentle silver moonlight was bright enough to see by. They soon reached the spring the cleric had spoken of and as Akris bent down to drink, his companion washed his hands, bloodied by caring for the wounded a bit further downstream. He had barely drunk two handfulls of water when the cleric's voice rang through the silent forest and a deep chill ran down his spine. "Father of law stand by us!" He felt more than than saw dark shapes passing him by. "Give your warriors the courage to stand!" The fear in his hard was sunddenly replaced by ire. He would not run again! Akris turned and drew his axe in one fluid motion. Then he ran towards the cleric that was loudly praying a few yards downstream. Shadowy shapes darted around him but he was surrounded by a nimbus of bright white light and they seemed unable to come nearer. But even as Akris drew nearer he could see the light dimming. The cleric had lifted his hammer high above his head and called triumphantly. "Give our wepons of the essence of law so that we may help uphold the eternal order and smite those who break the laws of life and death!" And with that the clerics hammer burst into a holy white fire. As Akris charged to help him he saw his own weapon flaming with a paler version of the cleric's flame and was astonished to find the shades recoiled from his presence as well. His axe cleft a shadow in two, the severed pieces falling to the ground as burning pieces of cloth, and he turned to face the next shadow. The cleric smashed another apparition with the hammer while bashing yet another with his shield. But each hit seemed to dim the flames of his weapons a little. "We have to get back! We can´t fight them for long!" They started back up the hill, all the time fighting defending against a never ending stream of ghostly opponents. Akris was almost ready to give up when they finally reached the fallen heroes guarding the camp and the shadows fled into the night.


He stood beside the cleric panting. Both of them too winded to speak, both tired and hurting. The cleric caught his breath first and panted: "Thank you my friend. Had I made that descent alone to go wash, as I had intended, I would have died down there." Akris was still too breathless to speak so he just shook his head. "It is true my friend. Though Junils power is great it needs mortal vessels to manifest. Tonight you and I were his vessels." The cleric still panting looked down the track they had come. Small white fires still burned wherever they had slain a shadow. It looked pretty and peaceful now. "The attack on us bodes ill." The cleric continued in a quiet voice. "The Einherjar warned me that our presence had awakened an ancient evil they had tried to seal away long ago. But I did not think it would grow in power that fast. The hill fortress we tried to take yesterday is its old stronghold and our attack woke it they said. I never imagined that it would slip its bindings that fast."

"I was bound in blood and in blood I rise!" a toneless whisper came with the wind. "Blood is power and your army had much to spill." The voice made Akris hairs stand on end and the familiar feeling of terror stole over him once again. From the campfire panicked screams could be heard, while the cleric was looking around, searching for the origin of the voice. "I am dead yet deathless. Three times I was slain and two times I rose. The third time I discarded my useless flesh and now I wear the flesh of hundreds. And yours will make a fine addition." The voice was quiet as a whisper but could be heard everywhere on the hilltop. "You should have kept on running." A thick tendril of darkness whipped out of the darkness and wound around the clerics waist. The nimbus of light he had called again died with a flicker and he screamed in pain as he was drawn back into the darkness. And wailing could be heard from the darkness of the forest. It sounded hungry, angry and full of envy. But amidst the ghostly screams the very human voice of the cleric could be heard, the high pitched scream of someone in terrible unbearable pain. And Akris ran. He ran past the ghostly sentinels that had drawn together as if awaiting an attack and past the wounded moaning and trying to crawl away. He ran out into the darkness beyond the firelight and into the forest where the small fires still burned.

And with that the clerics hammer burst into a holy white fire. As Akris charged to help him he saw his own weapon flaming with a paler version of the cleric's flame and was astonished to find the shades recoiled from his presence as well. His axe cleft a shadow in two, the severed pieces falling to the ground as burning pieces of cloth, and he turned to face the next shadow. The cleric smashed another apparition with the hammer while bashing yet another with his shield. But each hit seemed to dim the flames of his weapons a little. "We have to get back! We can´t fight them for long!" They started back up the hill, all the time fighting defending against a never ending stream of ghostly opponents. Akris was almost ready to give up when they finally reached the fallen heroes guarding the camp and the shadows fled into the night.


He stood beside the cleric panting. Both of them too winded to speak, both tired and hurting. The cleric caught his breath first and panted: "Thank you my friend. Had I made that descent alone to go wash, as I had intended, I would have died down there." Akris was still too breathless to speak so he just shook his head. "It is true my friend. Though Junils power is great it needs mortal vessels to manifest. Tonight you and I were his vessels." The cleric still panting looked down the track they had come. Small white fires still burned wherever they had slain a shadow. It looked pretty and peaceful now. "The attack on us bodes ill." The cleric continued in a quiet voice. "The Einherjar warned me that our presence had awakened an ancient evil they had tried to seal away long ago. But I did not think it would grow in power that fast. The hill fortress we tried to take yesterday is its old stronghold and our attack woke it they said. I never imagined that it would slip its bindings that fast."

"I was bound in blood and in blood I rise!" a toneless whisper came with the wind. "Blood is power and your army had much to spill." The voice made Akris hairs stand on end and the familiar feeling of terror stole over him once again. From the campfire panicked screams could be heard, while the cleric was looking around, searching for the origin of the voice. "I am dead yet deathless. Three times I was slain and two times I rose. The third time I discarded my useless flesh and now I wear the flesh of hundreds. And yours will make a fine addition." The voice was quiet as a whisper but could be heard everywhere on the hilltop. "You should have kept on running." A thick tendril of darkness whipped out of the darkness and wound around the clerics waist. The nimbus of light he had called again died with a flicker and he screamed in pain as he was drawn back into the darkness. And wailing could be heard from the darkness of the forest. It sounded hungry, angry and full of envy. But amidst the ghostly screams the very human voice of the cleric could be heard, the high pitched scream of someone in terrible unbearable pain. And Akris ran. He ran past the ghostly sentinels that had drawn together as if awaiting an attack and past the wounded moaning and trying to crawl away. He ran out into the darkness beyond the firelight and into the forest where the small fires still burned.


The fall of Astrum - A true tale by Cpt. Akris Steelheart</Italian>
		<Spanish>Akris stumbled through an overgrown riverbed. He was exhausted and shaking with fear. Also filled with shame as he had just lost his first command. The elders of the Chapter of the Burning Rose had entrusted him to lead Astrums levies against a lair of vile undead that haunted the hills north of the city. But Akris himself, just like many of his men had run when the Spectres came wailing towards them. Their cries had been a bonechilling shriek, while their bodies resembled humanoid shadows that flickered in and out of sight as they just passed through trees and boulders that lay before their path. Akris to his shame had broken and ran. He had not stopped running since then and now he had no idea where he was, nor what had happened to his command. The sun had come over the horizon hours ago, when he finally managed to clear his head enough of to stop. He had trouble breathing, his throat felt dry as sandpaper and as he fumbled for his canteen, he realized he had dropped it somewhere during his flight. He spent several hours looking for something, anything to drink, but found only some bitter berries that made his stomach cramp. At least though, it took care of the worst of his thirst, then he set out to find other survivors.

Night had already fallen when he finally heard human voices again. He had drunk from a pond during his wanderings and had even found some nutritious roots along his path. Now he heard voices which were the first sign of survivors he had come across, since he fled the hill. He stopped and listened. They were coming from beyond a hillcrest and the loudest among them was a prayer to Junil. At least a dozen people had joined their voices to a triumphant chorus, thanking Junil for the courage and resolve he had blessed them with, but also asking that he keep his chosen from harm this dark night. He sighed with relief that he did not have to spend the night alone in the forest and went towards the voices.

"Lord of Justice preserve us!
Keep the unclean from us!
We who keep thy order on Erebus,
beseech thee for thy blessings!"

The chorus of voices chanted. And a single voice answered leading them in their prayer.

"We few who have walked through hell and returned,
we vow to stand between the darkness and the light,
to defend those who cannot fight themselves
from all those foes who defy thine holy order!"

He could see fires beyond the hills crest and now also heard moans and the rattle of armor. He could smell food being prepared. But mixed with the appetizig smells were the smells of funeral pyres. Of men burnt to keep them from rising again this night.

"Lord of justice preserve us!
No matter how horrid our foe,
how unequal the odds we shall stand,
to defend your will and your order!"

Akris had crested the hill and saw maybe fifty survivors on top of an old burial mound around a big blazing fire. A cleric of Junil was leading the prayer of those well enough to pray, while in the flickering shadows the big fire cast many lay wounded or despairing. There were sentries too, but these were not Bannor soldiers, but ghostly figures glowing softly in the darkness. Akris had heard of such spirits but never seen them, they were the ghosts of fallen heroes, no doubt buried at this ancient site and they obviously had agreed to defend the ragged band that had sought shelter here. He stumbled into the camp helped by two of the silent glowing sentinels, and after a night and a day of fear he finally felt safe again.

"We beseech you Lord do not judge us harshly,
for we are but mortal men and mortal flesh.
And though law and order are unyielding and unbending,
we are weak without your help.

So keep from us death and darkness this night,
for we have already been tried sorely.
Keep from us the unliving and the undying
for thy will is our law and thy mercy our salvation."

Those were the last words Akris heard before he fell into a blissfully, unfeeling unconsciousness. He woke some time later, it was still night and found the cleric sitting beside him. He was an older man, his hair graying and his forehead and well trimmed beard gave his face a stern cast. But the wrinkles around his eyes suggested humor and compassion. "You have been sorely tried my son but you are safe here. I beseeched Junil for protection and he sent these heroes of a past age to be our guards and sentinels tonight. We have managed to put some food together and not far from here is a spring of clear cold water, so you will be able to regain some strength before we withdraw fully tomorrow." Akris looked around the camp and not much had changed since he had arrived, so he guessed that he had not been unconscious for long. "Follow me my son I will lead you to the spring and then we will see that you get something to eat."

They left the silent sentinels behind them and followed a path down the hillside. While they talked about the attack and how to best find the other bands of survivors, they suspected scattered in these dark forests. The forest was quiet and the gentle silver moonlight was bright enough to see by. They soon reached the spring the cleric had spoken of and as Akris bent down to drink, his companion washed his hands, bloodied by caring for the wounded a bit further downstream. He had barely drunk two handfulls of water when the cleric's voice rang through the silent forest and a deep chill ran down his spine. "Father of law stand by us!" He felt more than than saw dark shapes passing him by. "Give your warriors the courage to stand!" The fear in his hard was sunddenly replaced by ire. He would not run again! Akris turned and drew his axe in one fluid motion. Then he ran towards the cleric that was loudly praying a few yards downstream. Shadowy shapes darted around him but he was surrounded by a nimbus of bright white light and they seemed unable to come nearer. But even as Akris drew nearer he could see the light dimming. The cleric had lifted his hammer high above his head and called triumphantly. "Give our wepons of the essence of law so that we may help uphold the eternal order and smite those who break the laws of life and death!" And with that the clerics hammer burst into a holy white fire. As Akris charged to help him he saw his own weapon flaming with a paler version of the cleric's flame and was astonished to find the shades recoiled from his presence as well. His axe cleft a shadow in two, the severed pieces falling to the ground as burning pieces of cloth, and he turned to face the next shadow.

		<English>Undead are fearless. Why? Because they are mindless, only driven by the will of their creator. Undead feel no fear and will never refuse a command. They have no sense of self preservation. As you all know it is difficult tu hurl energies around even more so to hurl them at targets over great distances. So of course you can stop an attacking horde of skeletons by hurling fireball after fireball or calling lighning amongst their ranks. But no matter how many of them you destroy those you did not get will come on.

Fighting them with classical evocation you are pitting your strength against their strength. I grant you it is better than drawing your dagger and hurling yourself at them, but at the same time it is not a winning strategy. The best way to fight any enemy is to put your strength against their weakness. And their weakness is their singlemindedness. Literally in this case since a single necromancer of average power can hold hundreds of undead in thrall.

So the best way to fight them is either to go after their creator or failing that just to sever their connection to him. To this end we can use a simple anti magic enchantment we anchor to a line on the ground to sever the death mana flow between the necromancer and his creations. The enchantment itself is very simple and any adept can cast it. The trick is to get the undead to walk across the line, but usually the adept will suffice as bait. So if you plan to use this spell make damn sure you get it right. Because they WILL be coming for you, and if you messed it up they will get you.

		<English>Verlain tried to avoid bakeries. He never bought his bread there and even went so far as to choose side streets to get around them. This time though he had had no choice. He had been hired by a wealthy corn benafactor to act as his bodyguard and when his employer chose to visit a baker here in Karinstedt, he could hardly refuse to acompany him since he had already been paid. So he stood in the vending room of the bakery and watched the baker, a small man with a friendly face and white fringes of hair, haggled with his grossly fat protectee. One other bodyguard had come with them, a young amurite mage called Leoris but he seemed bored with this duty and had wandered off to inspect the different ingriedients the bakery stocked. Verlain had no need to, he could still have named most of them by their smell alone.

His thoughts went back in time and as always when he visited a bakery he could almost hear his fathers jovial voice berating Gralf the apprentice for burning some cakes. He had never seen his father really angry. The worst mood he ever saw him in was after Verlain and Riara, his sister, had started a flour fight in the bakery. And even then there was more concern for their safety in his mean, than anger at their foolishness. The smells here were not the same, this bakery seemed to use more anis and marjery than that of his father, but they were similar enough to incite a pang of homesickness, also the smell of the cakes made him remember his mothers smile. But such thoughts were no good he knew, and he tried to keep focused on the business at hand. This was hard since in the dimly lit bakery the only thing else he could focus on were his employer and the baker haggling over the price of rice grains. And business had always bored Verlain. So he started to count the flour sacks stacked against the wall for he knew that for every fond memory he indulged in now one other would come back to him in his nightmares this night. No he would keep focused and not think about how it all ended. Thirty two sacks of flour. Seventy five loafes of bread. Two pails of water. Three big ovens. 5 pairs of footprints on the flour dusted floor. He remained calm while his left hand went to one of the flour sacks, his right hand to the pommel of his sword and his eyes followed the tracks to his masters back.

		<English>The bakery was like the interior of a chimney in midwinter now, Verlain thought. The flour had exploded forth from the sack he had hit his emloyer with, the hit had sent the fat man sprawling. But his lunge had only met with empty air. His eyes were useless now the flour made it impossible to see more than a few paces into the gloom that was poorly lit with the shielded lanterns the shop had mounted on the walls. But, Verlain comforted himself, so were the assasins blinded now and against invisible assasins sight was a poor tool anyways. So he focused on his hearing and on touch. Had he heard a floorboard creak to the right? His lunge met only air again. Had he felt the faint whisper of a breeze on his arm? He swung but there was nothing there.

Leoris the wizard was still ruther stunned from the speed with which events had unfurled but Verlain could hear him begin an incantation. It would give his position away but there was nothing for it. "No fire or we are all dead!" Then he threw himself to the right but the dagger still cut a deep furrow in his arm. Then there was silence again. Verlain crouched close to his employer who had begun to stir again. Thankfully his benefactor was to terrified to do anything that would tell the attacker where they were. The time for explanations would be later, if there was a later for them. Then Verlain heard glass break and someone running for the door. He hurled his dagger blindly and shouted: "We have to get out! This whole place is gonna go up in flames!" And he bent down to help his employer up.

The bakery and several other houses on the block were burning brightly. The citizens had formed bucket-chains and were dousing the surrounding houses in water trying to contain the spread of the fire. The bakery itself had been given up. Verlain and Leoris knelt beside their employer. They had made it out just in time but all three of them had suffered nasty burns. Leoris seemed the least injured. He had mumbled something about a fireshield cantrip being useful for once. They had laid their employer on the ground, opposite the bakery and had started on treating his wounds who was by far, the worst hurt. So Leoris had sent Verlain to fetch a healer. "What if the assasin returns?" Verlain had asked. "It is a very difficult mental exercise to bend light and shadow and allow oneself to become invisible, it takes hours and hours of preparation and meditation to achieve it. I am pretty sure that we were facing was a Sidar Ghost and even they cannot do it twice a week. So to become invisible twice a day is simply impossible." Verlain reluctantly went in search of a healer.

It had taken him no more than fifteen minutes, but when he returned, he saw Leoris talking to one of the city guards and an acolyte of Lugus already bent over his employer. He was still fifty yards away but he drew his sword and began running as fast as his injured legs allowed. The acolyte seemed to see him comming and unhurriedly stood said something to Leoris, who barely aknowledged him and entered a side street. Verlain was still 30 yards away and his shout of protest was lost in the roaring and crackling of the fires. Then he arrived at his employers side crimson gushing from the fat mans cut throat and the sidestreet the acolyte had entered was deserted. He stood there sword in hand in the light of the burning bakery and cursed himself for a fool. He had forgotten the first rule his master had taught him so long ago: "Never assume the enemy has only one way to end your life boy!"

		<English>"Any and all necromancers are very careful when raising the recently deceased. Human souls vary in strength and the strongest sometimes linger for a while clinging to their convictions, to their need to live. Animating such a corpse is often fatal to the necromancer since such an usurpation of a still inhabited body is extremely painful to the soul and thus it instinctively fights back. If it wins the initial struggle, it can use the energy the reanimation provides it with to fuel its movement, and quite often to kill a stunned or exhausted necromancer. But Necromancy is not the only way to give these strong souls power.

Sometimes their conviction of what is right, their dedication to ideals of a flag, or a nation, or their love of their friends and families keeps them from drifting away for a long time. So they linger behind, watching over what they held most dear or believed most important in life. Yet they are only able to affect our world in minuscule ways, even long after their bodies have rotted away. But, if we give them of our power, if we can provide them with enough energy to manifest, they will come back to us. Not as the vile specters the necromancers summon, for they have lost all nobility all purpose and thus are only tools for whatever dark power calls them. But as beings as noble, pure and dedicated as they had been in life. Of course we cannot control them, but what need is there? They cling to our world out of a deep felt need to help. All we need to do is to provide them with is the means, then we can march proudly beside our ancestors and heroes of the past."

		<English>We Doviello pride ourselves on strength, agility and stamina. But the strong and quick rarely develop the introspection and empathy needed to understand and interact with the spirit world. So when the hunting parties form in the spring, we shamans and wise women are often left behind, so that we do not slow down the hunters. So we perform our augurs, paint the warriors with hunting paint and then retreat to our caves and tents to await their return, but that does not mean we remain idle. We too are Doviello, the wolves of the north, the merciless stalkers, the many fanged pack. So while our hunters stalk the mammoth herds and snow bears, those of us who can, call their spirit guides and join the hunt as animals. We are the hawks that spy the herds, the wolves that follow the trails and even the great snow tigers that drive the herds towards waiting spears. Those of us who are old enough, and sufficiently attuned to the beyond are even able to spend our dreams experiencing the glory of the hunt, and the satisfaction of tasting the blood of a fresh kill. While you are limited to one skin I have worn many. And while you will be left behind by the pack when your body fails you. I will be hunting as long as there are predators to hear my call.

The same way she calls to this rock, she calls to all of her children, and so it comes that you and I are standing solidly on the ground. To climb away from her is often a very strenuous experience. We are like all children, we can never truly leave our parents behind. While we might part from her for some time, we will always come back to her. And although we are tiny and our voices are weak, if enough of us gather and call out to her, she will respond with motherly love and reach out towards us. You ask how we can create hills? We cannot. We can only call and if she wills it, she will answer."

The same way she calls to this rock, she calls to all of her children, and so it comes that you and I are standing solidly on the ground. To climb away from her is often a very strenuous experience. We are like all children, we can never truly leave our parents behind. While we might part from her for some time, we will always come back to her. And although we are tiny and our voices are weak, if enough of us gather and call out to her, she will respond with motherly love and reach out towards us. You ask how we can create hills? We cannot. We can only call and if she wills it, she will answer."

	<English>Pedia Strategy:
The Bounty of Kilmorph spell enables your Runekeepers to discover a new minaral resource on a random plot within your empires borders.

Background:

The Khazad were at war. There was no shortage of young dwarves willing to fight. The years since the exodus from Underhome had seen a great increase in the dwarven population and the cities of the Khazad were filled with people, their vaults overflowing with gold, silver and gems. The craftsmen were still the most skilled in all of Erebus and the warriors well trained and dedicated. But all that had served to do was to provoke the greed of the Hippus. The merciless horselords had heard of Khazad wealth and they had come to take it not in trade but by force of arms. Now they were standing at Rockfall Pass and the fighting had been going on for months but eventually they would break through because there were no reinforcements to send. Oh there were enough dwarves willing to fight, but there was not enough steel to equip them. Not enough copper or even the beautiful silver and valuable gold were available for the Khazad, who could make servicable arms and armor even from such materials as these.

Runewarden Khalesh sat on the bare stonefloor of Rockfall Keep his head bowed in prayer, his hands caressing a fine chalice a silversmith had given him this morning as an offering to the earth mother to help the fortress in this time of peril. It was a masterpiece but the scenes it showed were grim indeed. Cavalry charging dwarven foragers, horses trampling priests, dwarven children running for their lives from a pack of Hippus hunting dogs. He felt the chalice and at the same time he felt the suffering of the dwarven people in the Keep and he felt the defenders fighting. They were brave and they were stubborn but they were also dying. Their blood flowing from the battlements they stood upon in small rivulets to sicker back into the earth from whence they had all come. Flowing back down to reuinte them with their mother. Khalesh followed the stream in his mind he followed it deep down into the rock where he felt the mothers presence and he felt her weeping. Weeping in anguish for the suffering of her children but also weeping in rage for the cruelty of the Hippus. Khalesh saw the blood and he saw the tears and where both liquids intersected he saw them harden to a silvery metal of utmost beauty. Born of suffering and sorrow this was a mothers gift to her children, a way to fight back against the invaders. Khalesh himself wept beholding it then he carefully retraced his steps in his mind and made certain he knew where the metal was to be found. Back in his body he immediatly ran to the Lord of Rockfall Keep. "Send for the head of the miners guild my lord. We have digging to do and there is not much time!"

        <English>I prepare my mind, don my armor and wield my sword and shield.

I hear the signal and an arrow is fired my way. I quickly utter a protective incantation and the arrow suddenly jolts to my right, missing me entirely.

I hear the signal again and two arrows are fired my way. Thinking fast, I set ablaze the first arrow with an ignition cantrip, and deflect the second arrow with my shield.

It is the same training each day, but I bare no mind to the repetition.

"The days of a Swordmage in training are days of near constant mental taxation and physical exhaustion. For hours we are pushed to our limits. Preparing our spells, equipment, bodies and minds for the dangers that we will likely face once we leave the comforts of our barracks.

		<English>"So you want to hear a tale of glories long gone? Ok then listen up I will tell you the story of the trials of Tesch´ Uggi a great Dwarven king. A long time ago no one is sure how long Tesch´Uggi was much beloved by his people but he was also lazy and so when he came out of underhome he decided he would build only one city and this one city he decided would be strong enough to dominate all of Erebus. So he sent runners to all the four corners of the world to find the perfect place for this marvel and after many adventures and many trials Tesch´Uggi had finally found the perfect spot for his city. In the bend of a great river close to where it joined the sea he would buid Occity the capital of Erebus or so he hoped. There was plenty of forest around his chosen spot with many a wild creature there to hunt, fertile plains close by where he could plant all kinds of grains and grazing lands for herds so big you have never seen their like not even the great cattledrives of the Hippus come close. The hills nearby seemed to be rich in precious stones and metals and the sea churned with fish. So he founded his city and it grew into a prosperous settlement but after a few years Tesch´Uggis subjects took up more and more of his time with their petty disputes and grievances. So he decided to install deputies that would judge such disputes in his stead. As the citiy grew the deputies became more and more and soon an entire district of Occity was given to them and they started to call themselves nobles and thought they were better than the dwarves who worked the fields, herded the cattle or toiled in the darkness of the mines. So now they began to argue amongst themselves and with those they had been chosen to lead. They wanted Jewelry but Tesch´Uggi could give them none because no one bothered with cutting the gems the miners found in Occity. You have to understand those were strict times then and one could either be a dwarf who had to work in the mines or the fields or the pastures the nobles owned or one was a noble oneself and to good for honest work. They wanted beer but Tesch`Uggi could give them none because the nobles did not want the stink of a brewery to pervade their gleaming district. They wanted many things and some of them the great king Tesch´Uggi could give to them others they themselves made impossible. Then came a time when the nobles of Occity saw another city grow not too far away and they urged Tesch´Uggi to declare war upon them. Long did Tesch´Uggi wait because he was lazy and he did not want to rule another city but finally he gave in and told his soldiers to burn the city to the ground and lead it´s people away to work in the mines and fields as slaves. But the city was across the sea and so to reach it they had to build big ships to carry their soldiers and those soldiers were heavy. A dwarf despite being smaller than a man is also much more compact thus weighing the same and the mines of Occity had produced weapons made of the finest steel and the furs of the animals they had hunted had been made into soft but durable armor so that each soldier had to carry around almost his own weight in equipment. And the generals came to Tesch´Uggi and said. Oh great king! Your army stands ready to attack those who build another city to rival your glorious creation but there is not enough wood to build our ships. And it was true because most of the forest that had surrounded the city had been cut away to make space for farms and the wood had gone underground to strenghten the mining tunnels. But Tesch´Uggi was wise and so he said: As there are animals that have better furs and Ores that hold more Iron there must be trees that are better in producing wood. And so he sent the finest minds of Occity into the woods to look for a Shipwoodtree. They searched from dawn till Dusk but found no such tree. After three months of searching there still was no wood for the ships so Tesch´Uggi stirred from his throne to look for himself. As he arrived in the forest he said to his people. I cannot believe that the gods have not made a tree that is fit for our needs, because the gods love Occity and they would not leave us alone in our plight. So Tesch`Uggi himself went looking for the Shipwoodtree and finally at dusk he came to a tree that looked special. It seemed to shimmer like bronze. He told his workers to cut all the trees of this kind, he called it Duskwood, and build the ships from them. But alas Tesch´Uggi knew many things but he did not know much about wood and the wood he had selected was the same as all the other trees that had been left because they were to weak to properly strenghten a mineshaft. And so his soldiers boarded the ships a few months later and they all sank into the ocean dragged down by their wonderous equipment. The other city was enraged at Tesch´Uggis plan and so they built a fleet of their own and burnt Occity to the ground. But from time to time one can still find things that have been fashioned in the great city of wonders and marvel at the craftsmanship that survives until today."

So he founded his city and it grew into a prosperous settlement but after a few years Tesch´Uggis subjects took up more and more of his time with their petty disputes and grievances. So he decided to install deputies that would judge such disputes in his stead. As the citiy grew the deputies became more and more and soon an entire district of Occity was given to them and they started to call themselves nobles and thought they were better than the dwarves who worked the fields, herded the cattle or toiled in the darkness of the mines. So now they began to argue amongst themselves and with those they had been chosen to lead. They wanted Jewelry but Tesch´Uggi could give them none because no one bothered with cutting the gems the miners found in Occity. You have to understand those were strict times then and one could either be a dwarf who had to work in the mines or the fields or the pastures the nobles owned or one was a noble oneself and to good for honest work. They wanted beer but Tesch`Uggi could give them none because the nobles did not want the stink of a brewery to pervade their gleaming district. They wanted many things and some of them the great king Tesch´Uggi could give to them others they themselves made impossible. Then came a time when the nobles of Occity saw another city grow not too far away and they urged Tesch´Uggi to declare war upon them. Long did Tesch´Uggi wait because he was lazy and he did not want to rule another city but finally he gave in and told his soldiers to burn the city to the ground and lead it´s people away to work in the mines and fields as slaves. But the city was across the sea and so to reach it they had to build big ships to carry their soldiers and those soldiers were heavy. A dwarf despite being smaller than a man is also much more compact thus weighing the same and the mines of Occity had produced weapons made of the finest steel and the furs of the animals they had hunted had been made into soft but durable armor so that each soldier had to carry around almost his own weight in equipment. And the generals came to Tesch´Uggi and said. Oh great king! Your army stands ready to attack those who build another city to rival your glorious creation but there is not enough wood to build our ships. And it was true because most of the forest that had surrounded the city had been cut away to make space for farms and the wood had gone underground to strenghten the mining tunnels. But Tesch´Uggi was wise and so he said: As there are animals that have better furs and Ores that hold more Iron there must be trees that are better in producing wood. And so he sent the finest minds of Occity into the woods to look for a Shipwoodtree. They searched from dawn till Dusk but found no such tree. After three months of searching there still was no wood for the ships so Tesch´Uggi stirred from his throne to look for himself. As he arrived in the forest he said to his people. I cannot believe that the gods have not made a tree that is fit for our needs, because the gods love Occity and they would not leave us alone in our plight. So Tesch`Uggi himself went looking for the Shipwoodtree and finally at dusk he came to a tree that looked special. It seemed to shimmer like bronze. He told his workers to cut all the trees of this kind, he called it Duskwood, and build the ships from them. But alas Tesch´Uggi knew many things but he did not know much about wood and the wood he had selected was the same as all the other trees that had been left because they were to weak to properly strenghten a mineshaft. And so his soldiers boarded the ships a few months later and they all sank into the ocean dragged down by their wonderous equipment. The other city was enraged at Tesch´Uggis plan and so they built a fleet of their own and burnt Occity to the ground. But from time to time one can still find things that have been fashioned in the great city of wonders and marvel at the craftsmanship that survives until today."

A long time ago no one is sure how long Tesch´Uggi was much beloved by his people but he was also lazy and so when he came out of underhome he decided he would build only one city and this one city he decided would be strong enough to dominate all of Erebus. So he sent runners to all the four corners of the world to find the perfect place for this marvel and after many adventures and many trials Tesch´Uggi had finally found the perfect spot for his city. In the bend of a great river close to where it joined the sea he would buid Occity the capital of Erebus or so he hoped.

		<English> ............... and so we often find ourselves in remote locations without the benefit of well established corpse supply chains. So the first order of business for a necromancer looking to establish the backbone (no pun intended) of a self contained economy is to procure an adequate workforce. Fortunately for us few areas of Erebus are so hostile nowadays that no remains of living creatures can be found conveniently lying aroung. Many necromancers today feel that reanimating animal corpses is beneath their dignity, and while I agree with them in principle (far more difficult and less rewarding when equally available) unless you plan to get down on your knees and do your digging yourself I suggest that you swallow your pride for the moment. Assuming you are like most of colleagues you won´t have much luck trying to track animals on your own so your best bet is probably to look for a waterhole or caves where animals and/or their remains are usually plentiful. During your search keep your eyes peeled for signs of past human habitation we will need that knowledge later on (no matter how old or faint those signs may be). As soon as you have procured some animal remains, whether by killing live ones or by finding suitably well preserved ones, start reanimating your most promising diggers. Any and all quadrupeds should be able to dig in one fashion or another, but I personally prefer bears, wolves or badgers while I try to avoid hooved animals, but again choice is a luxury you will not always have.

    Now that you have your impromtu workforce start looking for signs of human habitation. (For help in recognizing ancient burial sites see appendix B and use the appropriate subsection corresponding to your geographical and ethnological location.) Your common sense should tell you to stay clear of any presently thriving communities, pitchforks and torches have lost none of their power over the ages. But usually human nature has provided for an ample supply of untended graves in even the most remote locations. Old city ruins, battlefields or plague graves will work best but I also have used the grave of a long dead high chief once. When establishing your preliminary dig site two things are of the utmost importance. Number one is ease of acess you and your soon to be undead should be able to leave the dig at will without undue exertion. Number two is ease of concealment. If you start reanimating a mass grave in plain sight of a cities guard towers you will not be able to continue your budding career for much longer. Usually some sort of compromise is in order and I urge you to favour caution over ease of acess. Many is the young and promising necromancer.........

Copyists notes: This may be considered as the classical approach but necromancy has come a long way since then. If you cannot find a proper grave just ask a nearby city to send over a couple of hundred prisoners and ease of concealment is also rarely an issue.

Y´see a human smith spends a few hours making a plow and it´ll serve the farmer well for a decade, perhaps two. But then the shoddy workmanship those humans call smithing will show its flaws and fall apart, and he will have to make another plow for the same farmer. And while the human smith might smile because of the added business brought on by his own incompetence, the farmer undoubtetly curses him under his breath. That is why human smiths are always in a hurry, they have to do all their work again and again. While we do things properly but only once if we can help it. That is not to say our wares don´t break but they break because of misuse or old age not because of faulty craftsmanship. And while humans are quite willing to pay good coin for a plow they won´t have to replace for generations, what they are really after is our weapons and I can´t blame them. I wouldn´t wanna go into battle with a sword I can expect to fail when I need it most. Ah well look at me talking and talking. I should be helping you finding your way around the forge shouldn´t I? Well then soon begun-soon mended as my old master used to say. What do you need for your little project?"

I wouldn´t wanna go into battle with a sword I can expect to fail when I need it most. Ah well look at me talking and talking. I should be helping you finding your way around the forge shouldn´t I? Well then soon begun-soon mended as my old master used to say. What do you need for your little project?"

		<German>   "The cave is damp." Kandra said. "Yes lassie. You see we use water to temper the metal all that heat evaporates the water and since we are deep underground and the walls are cool, the water decides to stay here instead of looking for a way out." The grizzled smith chuckled. "What else do you notice?" Kandra hesitated then forged on, "I expected noise and heat, but it is quiet here and the air is cool. Also I expected boisterous apprentices and haggling customers but we seem to be the only ones here." Grinning the old dwarf stroked his beard. "It can get quite loud down here when the army needs things done quick, quick. Always in a rush they are topside. But here in the underhome, little darling, we like to take our time with things nothing good comes of rushing things. Also we are alone here cause the loud mouthed boys you expected are home with their families, I wanted you to have the forge to yourself for your smithing." The dwarf went over to a low table where he lit a pipe and sat down puffing smoke contently. "The real reason we are in no rush, lass, is that we plan ahead. Y´see a human smith spends a few hours making a plow and it´ll serve the farmer well for a decade, perhaps two. But then the shoddy workmanship those humans call smithing will show its flaws and fall apart, and he will have to make another plow for the same farmer. And while the human smith might smile because of the added business brought on by his own incompetence, the farmer undoubtetly curses him under his breath. That is why human smiths are always in a hurry, they have to do all their work again and again. While we do things properly but only once if we can help it.

		<English>Kandra stood before the showcases of the jewel smith, a gleam of longing in her dark brown eyes. The Master Smith was just finishing a sale to some noble of house thorne. The noble had evidently come to have a new signet ring made since his family had found a new vein of gold ore and thus the crest of his house had changed. Their rumbling voices argued quietly over some artistic details of the new ring, while Kandra imagined herself clad in gowns of silk and furs wearing the sappihre necklace that she imagined would go creat with her copper hair. Her imagination had carried her far away to the sacred halls beneath the mountains where she would dance the statley dance of artisans with some handsome and sucessful smith at her side, when the voice of the jewel smith abruptly brought her back to his shop.

"Can I help you dama?" Kandra looked up at him, he stood tall for a dwarf, and said rather hesitantly: "This might be a rather odd request and believe me, I do not wish to offend but I have a question to ask." "Iron and stone won´t be broken by words dama. Ask what you will." The smith quoted the old proverb and looked at her expectantly. "I have been told to find the most perfect of all the crafts. And so I came here hoping you could tell me where perfection can be found in the smiths art." "Aaah, so you are studying to become a thane dama? Very well I will answer as best I can but I warn you most answers you will hear will be different." The smith chuckled softly when he saw the look of surprise at her face.

"I can see that I am the first you visit with this question and I am honored dama. My answer is perfection can be found in many ways, sometimes it comes when you create something simple yet elegant, like a simple chain of copper links that falls gracefully. Sometimes you find it in the complexities of etching a family crest for a family so old and honorable it seems there is no way you can fit it all on a ring. But when you finish it looks just..... right. But most often I find perfection in perfecting my customers. If you find exactly the right trinket, the right ring the right diadem, you can make the other more of him or herself. A ring that might look perfect on one woman might make the other look too frail. A sapphire necklace perfect for the bride of a warrior would look out of place on a student of Kilmorph and so make her feel out of place."

Kandra tore her eyes from the necklace in the showcase and blushed a little. "I am sorry master smith i did not mean to appear inattentive." "Wait here dama I have something to give you." The smith went to his counter and opened a small ebony box. Then brought back a necklace of copper with a small silver and gold hammer, the symbol of Kilmorph, affixed to it and fastened it carefully around Kandras strong neck. "I made this for Orla my daughter but the blight took her. I kept working on it for years after that trying to make it perfect so that I might have something to remember her by. But perfection eluded me because without my daughter it could never be more than bits and pieces of metal. It fits you perfectly dama. I want you to have it." The eyes of the smith were bright with unshed tears as he looked at her. Kandra looked at the necklace around her neck and felt the cool metal on her skin. Then she looked at the smith and smiled with gratitude and empathy. "I am sure it would have fit your daughter perfectly. I thank you for this divine gift. And I will remember what you taught me today."

		<English>The sun was warm on his back and Varatus enjoyed the feeling while he worked. He had taken to working without his shirt on since his back had begun to trouble him a few weeks ago. As long as the sun was out and the wind was not too brisk, the warmth was soothing the aches and cramps he had accumulated over months of too much work and too little sleep. Even the painful twinge under his right shoulderblade seemed to lessen with the suns gentle kiss. But despite all the hardships the small aches and pains he was proud that he had been chosen to fashion the new statue of Junil for the new grand temple of in Torrolerial. It was to be his masterpiece. His friends had started joking about his devotion to this project, saying that he spent more time with his statue than many a newlywed man with his bride. But they had also tried to wheedle and cajoule him into showing them parts of his plans or a peak at the statue. And while it was true that he had spent almost every waking hour with his project what his friends did not know is that the statue even haunted his dreams. And so while he forbade them to look underneath the enormous sheets of canvas that covered the unfinished monument, except for whatever part he was currently working on he had gladly shown them the plans and joked with them, all the time trying to forget the disturbing images he saw night after night.

   He could not remember his dreams in full, only single images stuck in his mind and a general feeling of dread and unease. A gloved hand covered in serrated spikes, a forlorn wailing voice like that of a lost child, the feeling of being chained and dragged underwater by the weight of those chains, voices in an emty room, menacing and demanding at the same time and always at the end the beautiful statue of Junil driving back the darkness. The last one was the only image that remained clear in his memory and so he had taken to pondering the benevolent yet sad mien the god seemed to wear whenever he appeared in his dreams. He had also lost time the lack of proper undisturbed sleep made him fidgety and several times his chisel had shattered stone that he wanted to carve so he had fallen behind. But people all over town were complaining of strange nightmares of late and so he decided not to dwell on it and started to work until late at night so he would fall into bed exhausted to tired to dream. 

Varatus kept this up until the day of the unveiling came and while he was still disturbed by the images at night they had just fuelled his determination to finish the statue on time for the grand ceremony. And so he stood in the plaza of truth with the heads of the local orders beside him as Confessor Alvinius finished his speach. "............ and so brave soldiers brave citizens we are proud of your support in battling the Lanun child stealers and slave traders, last year we decided that we had had enough of their raiding, enough of their provocations and this year we celebrate the capture of Innishboffin the major center of slave trading this side of the eutrabean ranges. To mark this historic conquest the chapter of the inner flame commisioned a statue of our just lord Junil from your local master-sculptor Varatus. And it is my proud duty and honour to unveil it now, for all to be seen."

The canvas fell away and the speech was followed by stunned silence broken by screaming both full of fear and of outrage as the crowd stared at what Varatus had fashioned. And Varatus sreamed the loudest. He finally understood the images he had been seeing they were all parts of the statue. The gloved and thorned fist seemed to reach for the confessor, while the octupus head of the statue seemed to shout in triumph showing rows upon rows of shark teeth. That was all Veratus saw before his wits failed him and he slipped into unconciousness. But the crowd was less gentle and they pressed towards him intent on ripping him apart.

The canvas fell away and the speech was followed by stunned silence broken by screaming both full of fear and of outrage as the crowd stared at what Varatus had fashioned. And Varatus sreamed the loudest. He finally understood the images he had been seeing they were all parts of the statue. The gloved and thorned fist seemed to reach for the confessor, while the octupus head of the statue seemed to shout in triumph showing rows upon rows of shark teeth. That was all Veratus saw before his wits failed him and he slipped into unconciousness. But the crowd was less gentle and they pressed towards him intent on ripping him apart.

  - The Seemings of the Deep Ones - Pt.1 Visions</French>
		<German>The sun was warm on his back and Varatus enjoyed the feeling while he worked. He had taken to working without his shirt on since his back had begun to trouble him a few weeks ago. As long as the sun was out and the wind was not too brisk, the warmth was soothing the aches and cramps he had accumulated over months of too much work and too little sleep. Even the painful twinge under his right shoulderblade seemed to lessen with the suns gentle kiss. But despite all the hardships the small aches and pains he was proud that he had been chosen to fashion the new statue of Junil for the new grand temple of in Torrolerial. It was to be his masterpiece. His friends had started joking about his devotion to this project, saying that he spent more time with his statue than many a newlywed man with his bride. But they had also tried to wheedle and cajoule him into showing them parts of his plans or a peak at the statue. And while it was true that he had spent almost every waking hour with his project what his friends did not know is that the statue even haunted his dreams. And so while he forbade them to look underneath the enormous sheets of canvas that covered the unfinished monument, except for whatever part he was currently working on he had gladly shown them the plans and joked with them, all the time trying to forget the disturbing images he saw night after night.

   He could not remember his dreams in full, only single images stuck in his mind and a general feeling of dread and unease. A gloved hand covered in serrated spikes, a forlorn wailing voice like that of a lost child, the feeling of being chained and dragged underwater by the weight of those chains, voices in an emty room, menacing and demanding at the same time and always at the end the beautiful statue of Junil driving back the darkness. The last one was the only image that remained clear in his memory and so he had taken to pondering the benevolent yet sad mien the god seemed to wear whenever he appeared in his dreams. He had also lost time the lack of proper undisturbed sleep made him fidgety and several times his chisel had shattered stone that he wanted to carve so he had fallen behind. But people all over town were complaining of strange nightmares of late and so he decided not to dwell on it and started to work until late at night so he would fall into bed exhausted to tired to dream. 

Varatus kept this up until the day of the unveiling came and while he was still disturbed by the images at night they had just fuelled his determination to finish the statue on time for the grand ceremony. And so he stood in the plaza of truth with the heads of the local orders beside him as Confessor Alvinius finished his speach. "............ and so brave soldiers brave citizens we are proud of your support in battling the Lanun child stealers and slave traders, last year we decided that we had had enough of their raiding, enough of their provocations and this year we celebrate the capture of Innishboffin the major center of slave trading this side of the eutrabean ranges. To mark this historic conquest the chapter of the inner flame commisioned a statue of our just lord Junil from your local master-sculptor Varatus.

		<English>It had been five days since Serrato had been seperated from his recon squad. He had tried to look for them, but since the supplies had run out weeks ago, his immediate survival needs had more often than not dictated the course he must take. If one ignored the mud and rockslide that had seperated him from the expedition, the treck had been blessedly uneventful, even quiet. And though plant life grew to enormous dimensions in this hidden valley he had yet to see a single large animal. There were insects and birds aplenty but not  single mammal or amphibian bigger than a rat or a toad was in this jungle. Strangely though, there were paths in the jungle, whether they were old animal trails or paths that had been used and planned by humanoids he had not yet been able to decide. He was just now following such a path through enourmous ferns and groves of fresh bamboo grass. The jungle had become steadily quieter, not even a single bird could be heard anymore. Now that he concentrated on the absence of birdsong, he also realized that he could no longer hear a single insect. There was no "total" absence of sound he could still hear the leaves moving in the wind and the trees straining against their own weight. He moved an enormous fern that had grown into the path which enabled him to see a large clearing behind it, but at the same moment he became aware of hundreds of presences all around him. Serrato gripped his machete tighter and took two steps out into the clearing to get a better look at the enormous black and gold structure that rose before him.

 "The souls capacity for generating positive, and negative, emotions is limitless. What I mean, is given sufficient stimuli and energy, a single soul can translate all the energy input into positive or negative emotions and thus into highly nutritious food for me and my kind. The primitive way to feed would be to harvest all the naturally acummulated emotions that can be found in a  mortals soul."

Serrato ducked behind a near bush the cold emotionless voice he had thought to hear had scared him immensely. He took several deep breaths and tried to gather his wits again.

		<English>'BOOM'

		The great gates shuttered, the impact knocking the carpenters off balance as they furiously pounded in place an improvised barricade in a last, desperate attempt to support them.

		'BOOM'

		The wood in the doors began to splinter and bow inwards ominously, the drop bar keeping the gate shut bending in its frame. Korric's comrades shifted nervously on either side of him, one who was closest to the walls, absently brushed from his shoulder guards the dust shaken free from the masonry of the large stones beside him.

		'BOOM'

		Again the thunderous impact shook the gates, the cracks now formed on the masonry that framed the massive portal, fissures forming in the doors themselves where the lengths of oak from which they where made began to bend and pull apart from each other.

		'BOOM'

		Korric could sense the moral of his men begin to shake, not only from the blows that shook the stone around him, but also from the chanting that accompanied it.

		"Khazad"

		The hammering blows continued until nearly one hundred men, all that remained of the defenders, stiffened as one.

		'CRACK'

		A blade thin fissure snapped across the stones above the gate, neatly bisecting the keystone and sending a fist sized chunk of stone from its apex sailing across the courtyard beyond. Korrek felt an icy knife of dread cut threw him.

		'CRUNCH'

		The workers, panicked now, scrambled away from the overstressed doors as a portion roughly the size of a large mans helmet shattered outwards. Dagger sized Splinters slicing into there arms and hands, brought up in a feeble attempt to protect themselves.

		'CRUNCH - BOOM'

		with a final explosion of wood and stone the great bar across the gates snapped in half as if a stick over a knee. What remained of the doors slamming open and into the walls beside them, the metal hinges tearing free from the stone as if set into moldy bread. Behind them stood row on row of shields as tall and broad as those that carried them. There was a moment of panicked silence, broken as the chant continued without pause. The first row of attackers marching in time to it against the volleys of arrows and stones that rebounded impotently against there shields. There footsteps where as drums of doom.

		"ROOT"

		"thump, thump"

		"Khazad"
		"ROOT"

		"thump, thump, thump"

		Korrek's men surged forward like a flood onto the attackers, and where swept aside like waves on a mountainside. His men broke upon that wall of shields and spears, the body of the fallen trampled beneath the boots of the enemy.

Korric's comrades shifted nervously on either side of him, one who was closest to the walls, absently brushed from his shoulder guards the dust shaken free from the masonry of the large stones beside him.

		'BOOM'

		Again the thunderous impact shook the gates, the cracks now formed on the masonry that framed the massive portal, fissures forming in the doors themselves where the lengths of oak from which they where made began to bend and pull apart from each other.

		'BOOM'

		Korric could sense the moral of his men begin to shake, not only from the blows that shook the stone around him, but also from the chanting that accompanied it.

		"Khazad"
		"ROOT"

		'BOOM'

		"ROOT"
		"Dromie"
		"ROOT"

		'BOOM'

		"ROOT"
		"Atzobad"
		"ROOT"

		'BOOM'

		"ROOT"
		"Throne"
		"ROOT"

		'BOOM'

		The hammering blows continued until nearly one hundred men, all that remained of the defenders, stiffened as one.

		'CRACK'

		A blade thin fissure snapped across the stones above the gate, neatly bisecting the keystone and sending a fist sized chunk of stone from its apex sailing across the courtyard beyond. Korrek felt an icy knife of dread cut threw him.

		'CRUNCH'

		The workers, panicked now, scrambled away from the overstressed doors as a portion roughly the size of a large mans helmet shattered outwards. Dagger sized Splinters slicing into there arms and hands, brought up in a feeble attempt to protect themselves.

		'CRUNCH - BOOM'

		with a final explosion of wood and stone the great bar across the gates snapped in half as if a stick over a knee. What remained of the doors slamming open and into the walls beside them, the metal hinges tearing free from the stone as if set into moldy bread. Behind them stood row on row of shields as tall and broad as those that carried them. There was a moment of panicked silence, broken as the chant continued without pause. The first row of attackers marching in time to it against the volleys of arrows and stones that rebounded impotently against there shields. There footsteps where as drums of doom.

		"ROOT"

		"thump, thump"

		"Khazad"
		"ROOT"

		"thump, thump, thump"

		Korrek's men surged forward like a flood onto the attackers, and where swept aside like waves on a mountainside. His men broke upon that wall of shields and spears, the body of the fallen trampled beneath the boots of the enemy.

		"ROOT"

		The great gates shuttered, the impact knocking the carpenters off balance as they furiously pounded in place an improvised barricade in a last, desperate attempt to support them.

		"As in the age of Ice when days were short and darkness everywhere--some have to take up the torch, and be guardians to their fellow men. We are not a nation of warriors, but artisans, poets, philosophers, farmers, millers and ranchers. Yet if all light is extinguished, all men are the same; for our base nature is that of beasts, and to that nature we would revert were it not for the grace and the light of Lugus. Today we pledge to be the flame of hope and the shield of burnished steel for our small settlement. We who have gathered here, take this oath, so that our brothers and sisters do not have to. And so that our friends and family can live a safe and enlightened existance."

		[The commander stands quiet amongst his men waiting for the sunrise.]

		"As the sun rises I pledge myself to begin my watch.

		"There will be neither end nor pause to my vigil,
		for we are radiant in thought as well as in deed.
		I will not harbour secrets nor engage in falsehoods,
		for truth and light are one, just as darkness and lies.

		"I will help my brothers see clearly by my light,
		and should the candle of my vigil flicker and fail
		I know that my brothers will stand in my place,
		so that darkness and shadows cannot pass.

		"My place is not to seek out darkness,

		<English>He had gotten clean away. The millers daughter was dead and confessor Aldivatus did not even suspect him. But now it was time to leave the village and begin anew again. Secrets like his had a way of coming to light and he had to be away before the villagers suspected anything. Anette had been her name and she had been a sweet girl. And when she had smiled at him he had lost his lifelong fight against his inner deamons again. He had not meant to hurt her could barely remember her struggles against his workhardened body. But he remembered her crying afterwards, remembered she would not stop no matter what he said. So he killed her. He had hurried home then and begun to pack. No one thought it odd that he would go to town to buy supplies and confessor Aldivatus had even wished him a safe journey and a speedy return. Now he was well away and safe of all reprisals, or so he thought as a patrol of crusaders under the command of a cleric of Junil stopped him. They had no proof, they had not even suspicions all they had was the cleric claiming it was his face he had seen in a prophetic dream. And that someone would come looking for him soon. So they took him into custody waiting for the prophecised person to come. And sure enough after two days in the dark cells of a highway-guard tower confessor Aldivatus came for him. And when he was dragged back to the village to face Anettes family and to recieve judgement he begged Aldivatus for mercy, just as Anette had begged him. But all the confessor had to say was: "I do now know your soul so I cannot judge you with mercy else this might repeat itself. All I can dispense is justice. You will have to look for mercy from the gods."

		<English>"Are you serious? Turnips, again? Why the hell does the council insist on sending us turnips year after year? The great drought is now five years past yet they still keep on sending turnips." Assief leant against a clay wall still hot from the afternoon sun chewing tabacco and occasionally spitting unappetizing blobs on the tiled floor. He was supposed to be guarding the aid shipment but since no one could be bothered to steal it he was not a very attentive guard keeping his attention mostly on Musif who was unloading sack after sack of produce. After unloading the last sack from the first wagon Musif spit into his hands and started rubbing them. He hated unloading turnips he always felt they made his skin get brittle and dry. Well maybe it was the bags but he hated the labor nonetheless. Sighing he turned to Assief, "Seems a bit silly doesn´t it. But that is paper pushers for you. Hardly anybode lives here anymore and those who do need guns and swords more than food. If we did not store it all here it would probably get taken by orcish raiders the next day. And those Calabim night creatures, I doubt they´d take the turnips but food is not much good if there is no one around to eat it anymore. But they still sennd turnips to feed thirty- thousand people. I doubt that there ever were that many people in redsands province. Turnips for thirty thousand each month. And who is the lucky sod who gets to unload them........" Mumbling Musif went towards the next wagon to begin hi job anew while Assief followed him with a mischievous grin on his face. As Musif lifted the next sack from the wagonbed a seam ripped open and turnips rolled around in the courtyard of the granary. Musief cursed while his friend just laughed until a dry voice cut the laughter short. "You are right to curse. Your clumsiness just cost us a ramrod. Guns do not fire without ramrods. And a soldier whose gun does not fire while he stares at a charging oger........." "You must be mistaken Teutorix, those are just Turnips in these bags not guns." "As a nation we are forbidden by treaty to trade with the dwarves, but the dwarves just lost much of their farmland to the advancing veil forces and as you said before we need guns which the dwarves can provide. We are fomally at peace with the Vampires and the orcs although it is an uneasy peace at best, but the council cannot send weapons directly without threatening it. So the council sends us turnips purposefully forgetting to recount the population knowing full well that the nomads can exchange the turnips for guns with the dwarves. Take better care of my guns Musif."

		<English>The smell of burnt flesh was the worst. All his childhood friends lay scattered around Herik partly burning in theat infernal substance the Balor had spit at their unit and their smell reminded him of last mornings bacon. Heriks captain had died last just a few minutes, or few eternities ago, shot in the belly by one of the crossbow bolts the enemy had been sending uphill through the whole ghastly battle. Now except for the sizzling sound the corpses around him made as they were roasted in their own juices with skins cracking and Heriks dry heaving everything was quiet on the hillside. It seemed as if the the slaughter done the hill had been forgotten by the enemy. In the halflight of dawn it seemed as if he was the only one left alive. The only survivor of a night of butchery and slaughter. Shaking his head as if denying the possibility of so much death being real Herik started to crawl away. Dowhill into the shadows and darkness that was the way to go he thought the way to safety there no horrors could be seen and the still air would not carry the appetizing smell of his friends cooked flesh. Gods he was hungry, and hurt, and tired. His lips had cracked from thirst so he kept looking around the desolation he was crawling through, looking for water. But all he saw was death and horror mutilated corpses, burnt soldiers friends and enemies alike, and perhaps worst the wounded no one cared for, they whipered or cried out from time to time, but after the chaos and cacophony of before it seemed dead quiet now. 
		It was even quiet enough to hear a sharp snapping sound from the hilltop. As Herik looked up he saw in the light of a new dawn the banner of the fourth chapter proudly and defiantly being lifted by a battered young man. Then a weak cheer rolled across the hillside as the survivors saw the banner go up. And as the Flagbearer started signalling to regroup Herik turned around and started uphill again. He was not alone. They had held another night. All over the hillside other solders were climbing. Survivors like him, bloodied, tired, hungy and thirsty but alive. They would gather at the hilltop and Junil willing hold another night.......

It seemed as if the the slaughter done the hill had been forgotten by the enemy. In the halflight of dawn it seemed as if he was the only one left alive. The only survivor of a night of butchery and slaughter. Shaking his head as if denying the possibility of so much death being real Herik started to crawl away. Dowhill into the shadows and darkness that was the way to go he thought the way to safety there no horrors could be seen and the still air would not carry the appetizing smell of his friends cooked flesh. Gods he was hungry, and hurt, and tired. His lips had cracked from thirst so he kept looking around the desolation he was crawling through, looking for water. But all he saw was death and horror mutilated corpses, burnt soldiers friends and enemies alike, and perhaps worst the wounded no one cared for, they whipered or cried out from time to time, but after the chaos and cacophony of before it seemed dead quiet now. 
		It was even quiet enough to hear a sharp snapping sound from the hilltop. As Herik looked up he saw in the light of a new dawn the banner of the fourth chapter proudly and defiantly being lifted by a battered young man. Then a weak cheer rolled across the hillside as the survivors saw the banner go up. And as the Flagbearer started signalling to regroup Herik turned around and started uphill again. He was not alone. They had held another night. All over the hillside other solders were climbing. Survivors like him, bloodied, tired, hungy and thirsty but alive. They would gather at the hilltop and Junil willing hold another night.......

		<Spanish>The smell of burnt flesh was the worst. All his childhood friends lay scattered around Herik partly burning in theat infernal substance the Balor had spit at their unit and their smell reminded him of last mornings bacon.

		<English>	The positions at the ford were being overrun. The gaudily dressed carneval guards were falling back where they could, surrendering or dying on bannor pikes where they could not. Sparkling Top Hathad command of the archers on the ridge overlooking the ford. He had his men cease firing for now because the fighting was so closely packed now that there was no way to ensure their arrows would not hit their own desperatly battling men. While his fellow artists died at the ford Top Hat found time for reflection. Not yet twenty years ago the carneval had embarked on a mission to bring gaity and laughter to the oh so stern Bannor who languished in their self imposed steel cages of conformity. Now it looked as if the people of the great carneval would soon join the Bannor in their dreary cages. The fighting freaks and mimes were mostly dead or prisoners. Many of the knife throwers and arrow artists had lost their thumbs to the bannor and so would never throw or shoot for the delight of the crowd or the astonishment of an enemy again. Yes there had been pretty little to laugh at for Top Hat over the last few months. So he had sought consolation and gaity in the wine tents like many of his fellow troop directors.

		He cut out of his musings when he realized the din and clamour of the fight by the ford was dying down. Soon it was again eerily quiet at the ford and so the shouts and the singing from the beast handler tents could be heard again. The last supplies of wine and liquor had gone to the beast handlers and Top Hat was at a loss to understand why. When the war had started to turn bad there had been repeated tries to use their elephants in battle and while they were excellent beasts of burden and their highly prized tusks made them formidable fighters in the arena, the inabilty to reliably control them on a battlefield had almost always led to a rout of the beasts. And they would trample any number of friendly soldiers to get away from the battle. Their other beasts, lions, tigers, giant spiders, dog sized cockroaches had all proven usefull in ambushes. They had been easy to use by the simple expedient of not having any troops nearby, but the elephants had always just run away. And now this most useless of units got all the alcohol the army had left........

		Top Hat was not a man given to miserly behavior or jealosy but he was near to livid whenever he thought of those useless beasthandlers quaffing all the alcohol that was left while he and his men had to stand and die with barely a drop between them. And their loud capering and carousing could be heard all the way from their camp to his position so it was hardly possible to avoid thinking about them.

		"Sir, Hat, Sir!" one of the sentries called from a place further down the slope. Top Hat swaggered towards him. " Report private Fizzy Sludge." "The enemy is forming up again, readying to advance, sir!" His need for a drink forgotten Top Hat hurried back to the center of his line calling out orders: "Spikemen form up! I want two of your squares as breakwaters. Hold and funnel them. I want the enemy only able to charge up the center of the ridge! Give our archers time to shoot! Tubas sound the stand to!" Jolly oomphing marching music accompanied him as he went on giving orders. He and his 6000 archers and mixed infantry were the last force between the unsmiling Bannor army and Jubilee the eternal carneval. And although he was outnumbered six to one he did not intend to give his beloved city to the enemy without a fight. No joke, he would bleed them, bleed them like a Calabim princeling. And what a fine way to face the end Top Hat thought. The jolly polka his tubas played as a call to stand to was acompanied by the jarring and arrythmic clanging of the spikemens´ bands, and the high pitched ringing of the NCOs bells of rank.

		"I need your men to fire flaming arrows into the grass at the foot of the ridge, Sparkles." His reverie rudely interrupted Sparkling Top Hat turned around to see Yellow Groin Strap casually sauntering towards him. Top Hat opened his mouth to tell the insufferable man, he commanded the beast handlers, to go entertain Hyborem, but Groin Strap spoke first. "Don´t just stand there gaping man! I need your fire arrows at the foot of the ridge else my boys will go charging of Perpentach knows where." Still trying to make sense of the of the order, who the hell is going to charge the Bannor and why do they need fire arrows shot in to the damp grass, Top Hat decided to go along. "Archers ignite arrows!" The hooting and laughing from the beast handler camp seemed to draw closer and amidst the shouts he could also here the terrified trumpeting of elephants. What the hell it was his last stand anyways. "Aim at the foot of the ridge boys!" He saw enormous dark shaps running in front of a line of beast handlers making straight for the flat plain between his ridge and the ford, right where the Bannor assault troops were massing. And then he understood what groin strap was doing. "Aim low boys do not shoot the Bannor shoot the grass at the foot of the hill. Shoot low! Aaaaaand lose!" Panicked and drunk boxed in by fire the only way the elephants could go was towards the ford, towards the Bannor. Where they normally would have turned and run as soon as the Pikes stabbed at them, they now grew enraged and charged the men stabbing at them spearing amen with their tusks and trampling them underfoot. For Top Hat watching from the hill it was a glorious sight. He kept his archers firing flaming arrows inching forward. driving the elephants before his barrage of fire. Until the Bannor broke and the Belseraph charged down from their ridge it was the Bannors´ turn to die............

		Alone on the hill Yellow Groin Strap whistled a melody. He chuckled. "As always guidance is much more effective than control."

		<English>	Harron had left the trees of the Harthorne woods behind months ago, yet whenever he closed his eyes trying to find the peace sleep brings, he was back there. His horses flanks were shaking and wet from fear and exhaustion. The eyes open wide as phantoms raced along the uneven forest track by night. The sounds of hooves were all around them as the other riders of the emberlance mercenary units galloped on in heedless flight. The sounds of hooves on forest floor and heavy breathing, broken by a scream of pain when a horse went down due to their reckless flight across ground strewn with obstacles. Everyone would gallop on ignoring their fallen comrade and his horse except perhaps only to steer around him so as to not to share his fate. And every time one of them went down and was swallowed by the shadows of the forest, a scream of terror would erupt and then change to one of excruciating pain, could be heard shortly afterwards as the dark kin dispatched those who failed to keep up. Pictures would flash through Harron's mind as he sought for sleep in vain. A dark forest, the moon seemingly the color of blood. Riding through a ravine at full gallop, looking up and seeing his captain strung up across the ravine, still alive still breathing, the dripping blood leaving a metallic tang in his gaping mouth. Corporal Dannon slowing down. His words "I think we lost them.", followed by the sight of an arrow sticking out of his left eye. Panicked flight again. Fewer men around him perhaps twenty. Harding's horse collapsing at a ford and Harding begging to be allowed to ride with someone else. Nobody was willing to take him so Harding jumped at Marksin and fell back down with Marksin's knife in his throat. A roar sent the horses scattering. Corporal Mercher hit something galloping ahead, Mercher's severed head sailed by, panic fixed on his face as Harron ducked under the wire that had decapitated Marksin. No rest, arrows from every bush. A large clearing in the shadow of an enormous oak. Survivors starting to rein in. A roar from above followed by arrows. An arrow sticking in his right shoulder. The poison burning its way through him. Clutching his horse. And then blackness.
        They called Harron a survivor. The survivor would be more appropriate because he was the only one. But tonight was different. The others were joking after all the Svarts were beaten, their cavalry had fled to the woods the plains were taken. Tomorrow the army would follow them back into Hawthorne. The army but not Harron, the survivor because he lay in his tent his wrist cut open closing his eyes to finally find peace.
