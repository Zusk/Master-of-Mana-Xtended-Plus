		<English>The effect rippled through out creation.  At the moment of his death the Frost Speakers awoke from their mind of stasis.  This quickening was more shocking than the fall of Bhall.  It wasn't the newly initiated that had to pay the price; it was those that served the longest that suffered the most.  Those closest to the sphere of ice died outright and those that did survive felt the call of chaos.  This was an unwelcome concept to those that walked with Mulcarn, causing varying degrees of insanity to inflict the rest.

From Rickets beginnings she never had much divine power, as the last Frost Speaker to be initiated, the touch of chaos was weak within her.  Learning to tap into the powers of magic she studied ways of channeling the Ice sphere, without success.  Through Lichdom she carried on until one day she felt a small, an ever so slight call.  It was the power of her former god, though not ordered it called out to her.  Searching she found an Illian settlement and a man claiming the right of godhood.  With his research, a touch of magic, and the original frost ritual, a small if not distorted sect of women began to harness a small amount of Ice mana created by Auric.  From these beginnings the Frost Maidens are the spiritual successors to the Frost Speakers.  They don't have the full potential as the Priest of Winter, but they fill the gap and stayed true to the sphere of ice.   As for Rickets, well she was later killed by Auric in his studies to create true and powerful Priests of Winter.  For their faithfulness to Auric, he bestowed upon them a unit of Frostling's enslaved to each newly initiated Frost Maiden; they are a most welcome sight to the armies of Auric.</English>

		<English>We were promised reinforcement and we got them indeed.  Hyborem's Army was small by contrast and from the look of the enemy facing us today we would not come back alive.  Elohim healers about as needed, Kuriotate Centars on the flanks, Bannor Champions center, and a few surviving Amaruite Firebowmen and Mages taking up the rear.  The battle lines drawn and our forces less than equal, a mage materialized at our front lines.  No word was said for we knew who she was.  With her use of dimensional magic, our queen could be at anyplace at any time (some say she can be at two places at once).  Her rugged beauty and dark eyes rang in all of us.  She was not one for glorious speeches, but today was different.  She entered the minds of each of us and spoke of the battle to come, “unlike me, death awaits you today, but like me you will not leave the field of battle before we have won.  In your death you will rise again molded by the Infernals into a force that will end ALL of THIS.  In one moment there were hundreds of her then thousands and then none.

		<English>	When an Amurite comes of age, they usually choose a sphere of magic that matches their intent. A battlemage, for instance, often chooses Fire magic, for it’s potential for destruction. However, for the inhabitants of the Iltanie Islands, water reigns supreme. These islanders fallow the path of the Hydromancer, with most aspiring to fallow in the foot steps of Lorelei Coral, the greatest Hydromancer of the age.

“The Elves have no navy to speak of, the problem is their Lanun mercenaries” said Admiral Akurl, addressing the war council. “If the Lanun vessel’s can be handled, the Elven ships will pose no threat to our Windriders.”

“What of the Jotnar fleet?” asked a general in the back of the room.

“To far away to be a threat” answered the admiral, shaking his head. “None of are mages are powerful enough to attack the ships directly, they have some Mechanos magic dampening device.”

“What if we attack the water?” asked a soft female voice form the crowd.

Akurl frowned, something about the voice unnerving him. “I see you logic, but none of out mages are powerful enough to do that.”

A slight young woman in a robe stepped out of the crowed. She smiled slightly. “Then I will destroy the fleet myself”

Akurl felt like laughing, but one look at the women caused him to change his mind. “Maybe you can”

Late during the night, a storm blew up out of nowhere. Rain sleeted down, waves tall as hills flipped ships, yet strangely, there was little wind, no lightning, and some of the few surviving Lanun clamed they could see the stars clearly. Soon after, Lorelei Coral was appointed to the council of Archmages at the personal recommendation of both Queen Valledia and Caswallen Dain.

		<English>Nish started as Lady Kyri burst into the room in her usual rage. He glanced at Maelys, another of Lady Kyri’s aids, then approached the Lady.

“Lady Kyri, I have good-”

“Who do they think they are!” she screamed, cutting him off. “They think this research facility is a waste of money! White Mesa is the Future! So what if some adepts are killed in the process, they are always more.”

Nish glanced at the other aid, terror in every eye he saw. It was times like this he wished he’d taken that internship at Flesh-Crafters. At least there they tried to keep things safe. A well, he was the head aid.

“Lady Kyri?”

“What!” she snapped.

“Is something wrong?” he asked, trying to control his voice.

“They think we are not accomplishing anything! They think we’re to expensive! HA! As if they knew what cost was!”

Yes, Nish thought, a few adepts die. The Councils problem is probably not how many adepts die, but how many go mad and need to be taken care of.

“I know cost, I know true power is expensive, but I still reach for!”

Yes, but that’s because you’ve been mad since your Trial of the Caves.

Nish opened his mouth to speak, but Lady Kyri cut him off. “I will be in my quarters. No one disturb me.”

She then turned and stormed into her rooms. Out of sight of the aids, she let the tears fall free, then reached over and picked up a small portrait she had. The portrait had been painted from an image she had had pulled from her mind my a mind mage, and was of a young boy, about 10. As she looked at the portrait, she let her memories of the child lost to the Trials fill her mind, the child she had miscarried due to the strain, yet that had guided her throught. As she thought, she felt her resolve strengthen. Those adepts might lose their minds, but their loss was nothing compared to hers. She knew it. 	</English>

        <English>For all the heat, my blood ran cold as an Illians heart. Again I cursed that slip of the tongue that angered my lord so. Now I stood on the deck of the Swiftsure and knew fear.

Captain Sören look over and saw my knuckles white upon the railing and laughed, “Do not worry counselor. I told His Lordship I would bring you back in one piece so you will be able to report on all the money he has spent on these ships. Oh I grant you that it is a sight to see; unnerving to see such a line of ships all bearing down on you. Do not give it another thought; we will have a lot of unhappy fish trying to eat those tainted Scions soon enough.”

“Captain, it is not those ships that I am fearing right now. It is the fact that I am aboard a wooden ship that is filled with more fire than one could expect from a private hell!”
--Naval Counselor Brexio on board the Swiftsure prior to start of the Battle of Aduro Straights

Most land-lubbers think an Arcane Barque to be merely a shipped filled with mages trained in the arts of Fire mana. This could not be farther from the truth. In actuality the magic involved is the direct opposite. What are taken to be fireballs by the ignorant are actually catapult shot that are treated with a volatile and very combustible material. It is the ship itself that is filled with magic. Prior to ever leaving the slipway, a Arcane Barque is magically altered to make it as proof against fire as can be. Only in this way is it safe enough for the wooden ship to carry its deadly ammo. </English>

		<English>Magic comes easily to Amurites.  While for most units the Amurites bring to bear against their enemies this means they have the time to easily pick up one or two cantrips, for those dedicated to magic it means that the mastery comes easier, and thus they have time to extend their own knowledge further into other disciplines.  Most learned Amurite mages stay back in the towns, teaching in the Wizard's Halls.  The units that the Amurites field in offense and defense are not Archmages, but the fearsome Battlemage unit - powerful, talented mages who have also seen fit to understand how to operate in a combat situation.  Battlemages can fend off enemy combat units with ease compared to other civilization's Archmagi, and are a valuable asset to any Amurite army. While only slightly stronger than the standard, they can also use Bronze, Iron, and Mithril weapons, and they have a bonus against land units.


He reached the top of a modest hill to see down the slope toward the cliff to the Idryn valley. There, the demon phalanx had been met by a unit of Amurite Battlemage company ludicrously small by comparison. But it was not the mundane attack that captivated and horrified: the phalanx was under assault by ritual battle magics. A tornado plucked outof the realm of Air squatted over the unit plucking up demons into its gyring maw. There they twisted, doll-like, limbs flailing, some being swept down to bowl over entire ranks. There they collided and, sometimes, erupted, disappearing in clouds of burst flesh and fragmented armour.

Journals of chanter-master Ferret
Chapter 9 - Utter eastflank of the battle of the Ciriail crossings.
The turning point in the Amurite-Infernal war 344-349 AoR


"Feel your center! It is the balance point of your body. It is the quiet, disciplined part of your mind,. It is the denial of all but what is important. Without that center, you are doomed. The weight of your armor, the clang of arms, the rush of mana power coursing through you, even the blood rushing through your veins will distract you and kill you.

You are the Amurite elite and the heirs to Kylorin and His gifts to us! The other races pretend to work magics and while many like the Sheaim have crude skills, only we Amurites can remain so centered to wade into the foe with magic and weapons united."
--Foran the Warder, Cevedes Training Yard Master, to his students before dismissing them for the evening meal.

If there is one truth that even the most unlettered peasant knows is that magic can kill. Drawing the mana from the node, harnessing its power into spell craft and then using it in battle, all phases are fraught with danger. Thus most adepts and mages keep their distractions to a minimum and thus are clad almost as penitent monks who have cast off worldly possessions. In contrast, the Amurite Battlemages stand in stark contrast. Their well oiled chainmail, gauntlets of hardened swamp troll hide and their maces blazing with the Flame of Kylorin all conspire to create havoc among their enemies. Will they charge or send a wave of fireballs into the line...or both.? Only the Scion Necromancers are a pale rendition of this powerful arm of the Amurite army.

		<English>Magic comes naturally to the citizens of the Amurites, so much so that it's not uncommon to hear reports of children harassing each other with cantrips, or the city guard finding a criminal with a simple light spell.  This extends into the higher understandings of magic too, and those who truly dedicate themselves to the path of the arcane become fearsome and respected at the same time, pillars of their community and the armies of their nation.  Amurite Wizards are potent examples of what the lineage of the great archmage has wrought in these people.</English>

		<English>How had it come to this? One day Essom’s village stood on the border of the Elohim lands, adjoining Balseraphs, his people happily tolerating the bizarre antics of the troubadour nation. The next day the village was in Balseraphs territory and his people were slaves. More startling, they accepted it mindlessly, as if it were the most natural transition in the world.

“Stand up straight, ye lazy popinjay, he’s coming,” Faro snarled.

Yesterday such a remark would have been accompanied with the sting of the whip, and the river would have run with blood, but, for today at least, the slaves have been given the day off, so that they could form a crowd of grateful faces, all appreciatively welcoming Perpentech, the Blasphemy made Flesh.

The clown prince arrived wearing a red suit with black buttons and golden tassels and trim, the kind that adorned doormen on official state occasions. The orchestra began to play the official Balseraphs national anthem, The Dance of the Deer and Duck.

“No! No! No! No! No!” Perpentech squawked. “You’re doing it all wrong. You on the fiddle, go and play the harp. And you, yes you, with the trumpet and the big nose, fetch the timpani. And tell the choir to swap with the piccolo section, whilst you’re at it.”

Essom watched the havoc as musicians swapped places with one another, desperately trying to locate an instrument with which they might bear at least a passing acquaintance. It occurred to Essom that Perpentech had quite the most ridiculous voice that he had ever heard, a squeaky, reedy thing of no substance. And yet, such was his charisma, no-one ever heard the voice, just the threat behind it.

“And a one-two-three, and in your own time.”

The resulting melange lacked rhythm, melody and talent, but made up for it with an enthusiasm born of fear. As discordant notes slid into one another with all the elegance of a coach crash, Perpentech swayed from side to side, flicking his wrist here and there in time with some overblown bugle cry or inappropriate cymbal clash. The tempo varied wildly, some musicians finishing early, whilst others were drawn into extended solos. A capella competed with soto voce, and the lyrics fared little better; at least half the choristers started by singing last week’s National Anthem, Two fiddles and a tug by Solstice Eve.

“Excellent! Excellent! Isn’t out so much better when you don’t play the music laid out for you? Now where are my doves?”

“Doves, Sir?” asked Captain Faro

“Doves. To announce my presence of course!” Perpentech sighed. “If you want something done, do it yourself.” Essom had not seen the prince change his clothing, but now Perpentech was wearing a dark suit with a top hat. With a flourish, the harbinger of chaos swept out his left arm and a swarm of locusts emerged from his fingertips. They clustered together in the form of two doves and then flew into the crowd.

“I apologise for the lack of facilities, sir. It shan’t happen again.” Captain Faro toadied, but Essom had seen that face before. Tomorrow the whip would be twice as harsh.

“I say, Captain, do your feet sweat and stink in this heat?”

The non-sequitur stunned Faro into stammering affirmative response.

“Well we’ll have to do something about that.” And Perpentech seized a nosegay from the buttonhole of the silk pyjamas that current served as his raiment. Peeling the petals from the rose, he plucked them delicately letting them drift on the breeze.

Somewhere in the crowd a voice cried “She Loves Me.” With the next petal, “She Loves Me Not.” Soon the entire multitude was declaring undying affection and remorseful regret with each petal, until, with the final "She Loves Me Not", the petals danced on the wind to smother the sun and darken the land below.

“Now show me the project.”

“Of course, Sir.”

“And do stop calling me, Sir. It sounds so formal. From now on you must refer to me the Most Beneficent Augur of Munificence and Virtue.”

Captain Faro nodded and showed Perpentech the way to the structure. Three pillars stood in the desert, each a monument to the blood and pain of Elohim slaves. Carved marble masonry, engraved with etchings of frogs and toads dying in burning hail, lay discarded at the side, pieces of a jigsaw that don’t fit in place.

“In fairness, Si... Your most Beneficent Augur of... er... Our architects don’t understand how you expect all the stairwells to be going up all the time.”

“Really.” Perpentech, now dressed in a gold robe which covered him from head to foot, stretched out his arms. “We can’t have that. After all, I can hardly be expected to have servants living below stairs if I don’t have a staircase in the first place. Allow me to demonstrate.”

As Perpentech dropped his arms, a figure appeared behind them. Or rather three figures, three dwarves standing atop of each other. The one at the bottom had so many sores and boils it was hard to make out his visage. The central one was smothered in lice and flies, whereas the one at the top, who was slightly taller than the others, had a stage dagger plunged firmly in his chest.

The dwarves at the top and the bottom of the stack stuck their arms out, bending their elbows and hands to point at right angles. The central dwarf spoke. “My name is Weevil and below me stands Pickle and above me stands Hyde.”

The tower of dwarves then rotated on the spot, slowly shuffling until they faced the audience once more. Although there had been no apparent change in the tower whilst their back was to the crowd, now the dwarf with the boils occupied the central spot, with the tall dwarf at the bottom and the lice-infested dwarf on the top of the stack.

This time, the dwarves at the top and bottom of the stack made surprised faces, eyes wide open, hands covering their mouths in mock-astonishment. The central dwarf spoke once more. “My name is Pickle, below me stands Hyde and above me stands Weevil.”

The tower rotated once more. When it faced the audience again, the configuration of dwarves had changed. The dwarf with the flies was at the bottom of the stack, the palms of his hands covering his eyes. The central position was occupied by the dwarf with the stage dagger, his hands closed over his ears. At the top was the pockmarked dwarf, a hand cupped across his mouth. The central dwarf spoke again. “And my name is Hyde, below me stands Weevil and above me stands Pickle.”

“So there you have it,” stated Perpentech, as if he had just taught a child how to count to ten “When you build my staircase just remember Weevil, Pickle and Hyde.”

“Erm... Right” replied Faro. He almost sounded like he believed it.

Perpentech clutched his nose, as if to stifle a sneeze. "I do apologise," he squeaked nasally, and then broke wind with aplomb. Reaching down, he withdrew a handkerchief from his backside. As he pulled, another handkerchief came out, tied to the first, and then another, a different colour from the others. Perpentech pulled the string of ever increasing handkerchiefs up to his face and wiped his nose.

“Just a little cold I seemed to have picked up. My nose just won’t stop running. Does your nose run, Faro?”

“Sometimes, Your Most Ben...”

Perpentech stepped forwards in gleeful triumph, his satin leotard sparkling with baleful luminescence. "Well if your nose runs and your feet smell, you must be built upside-down." Faro started in his horror and seized his face. In the centre, where once his nose had been, there was a large toe. Poking through his sandals, a nose sniffed it’s new surroundings with horrified curiosity.

Essom mused on what he had seen. In a land where only the ringmaster can sing the song destiny intended, everyone else is a slave.

--‘Chronicles of Khonahn: The Road from Rage to Power’ - Thadan Welhm, Amurite sage

The clang of arms, the swearing of drill masters, the smell of leather and sweat is what is found in most training yards across Erebus. Yet in the lands of the Balseraph, this training isn't kept hidden but exploited for entertainment. Mistakes that would get a upcoming soldier extra detail or a cuff to the side of the head bring boos and often a death sentence. Those who survive their training and able to please the fickle crowds are often the most dangerous (if flamboyant) of all warriors of Erebus. Often these crafty warriors join the elite ranks of the Mimics, famed for their ability to ape their enemies abilities. </English>

		<English>Anagantios was a Great Warrior of his time. The magic which flowed through his body was impossible to destroy. But he was decieved. His life, his family, his beloved and lovers would soon be killed. He at once heard news 3 days before battle. He then asked "Commander, My family is under the pressure of darkness and evil. They are going to be killed at once- I have to save them before this battle- Please sir. I beg of you." Begging was not a normal trait of this Warrior, his mind brillant, his muscles strong. He was not of looks to be the beggers of society. The commander stood from his table. Frowned and tall, his eyes seemed never to leave the floor. The commander then said "Leave to save you beloved, but be back by next battle or you'll be considerd as a traitor, that is all I can grant." The commanders eyes still concentrated on the ground never even looked up to see Anagantios leave the tent.

Anagantios rushed through many fields and places of ice, seeming as if this waste land would never stop. Frostlings then appear out of the ice, holding hammers and clubs. Seeming to show no interest in Anagantios he passed by without any clue to if they were to rob. He still runs exhauted and tired he can run no more, he gets dazed and dizzy, stumbiling and tripping he soon falls. Hits his head only to be a rock. His brillance would be looked over on this rock.

Anagantios woke up to find his self in the cold alone stranded in a blizzard. He then guesses hes been stranded for a couple hours. He realizes he has blood straining from his head to his stomach. He gets up, then he starts to walk in the insane blizzard only realizing his beloved could be dead. He runs to his family tent. He enters...

His family is dead. Their inerds rip thrashed across the wall, no respect for his family he is angered crazed and enraged with rage and discrimination towards other civilizations. His Wife, her eyes gouged her body torn, her dressings ripped, this murderer has no sympothy for her. His two sons nailed to the wall, missings fingers and backs thrashed with some sort of object. His brillant mind was now enraged and crazed. He only knew he would set out for his long revenge.

By the time he reached back to his war camp, his eyes squentinted, his breath heaved, his fisst crinched and his voice strong. He was ready to relive his stress and rage the war was coming and he was going to annihalate the other enemys.</English>

		<English>Auditor Akrus paced steadily down the long, narrow tunnel. It's length seemed pointlessly excessive, and an apparent waste of funding.

Looking at it, Akrus couldn’t help but sigh and shake his head. He turned to glance at his guide, Thrumbl. A filthy miner who was busy picking…things out of his beard. Suppressing a shudder of disgust (thanking Kilmorph that city dwarves were cleaner), Akrus asked the miner where the Foreman was.

“Oh, ri’t this way, Aud’tor, yur Honour.” Thrumbl muttered in a careless dialect.

Sighing once more, Akrus followed Thrumbl down the tunnel, visibly dismayed at the lack of work he saw. Only the occasional labourer chatting, lazing around, gambling, and drinking. Nary a pick or worker in sight. After what seemed like an hour of marching, he and Thrumbl emerged from the tunnel into in a large, well lit cavern. It dawned on him where all the workers had been. On scaffolding all around the edge, they were hammering away at the rock walls.

“Thar’s him, Farman Reorx Veinhunter.” Exclaimed Thrumbl, pointing towards the back of the chamber.

"Hmph, 'Farman'? Veinhunter? Given what I’ve seen, he might as well be Reorx Moneywaster", thought Akrus as he strode towards a fairly tall dwarf.

“Mr. Veinhunter? I’m Auditor Akrus, it is…good to meet you.” He said in a dry voice, noticeably lacking sincerity.

“Greetings. Call me Reorx, Auditor. To what do I owe this honour?” The Foreman said in clear, well pronounced Kaz’ak.

“No honour in this visit, I’m afraid. Lord Kandros is getting impatient with this dig. You've tunneled miles into the earth, bypassing useful veins of copper I'm told, and for all the funding and men that have been allocated, you've produced nothing in the way of results. I've been ordered to shut down the excavation here, and issue the command to cease work.”

Reorx only smiled knowingly, raising his arm towards the scaffolding on his far left.

"Follow me, Auditor. I've somethin' to show ye that'll make Kandros change his tune right fast"
Akrus, frowning, following over to the wall, and climbing haphazardly up the sides of the scaffolding. Workers stepped aside to let them pass as Reorx led the auditor over to a part where the wall had been especially cut in.

"Demonstrate to the Auditor what we've got here, lads"

Two nearby workers lifted a large pick from the floor, and swung together at the rock wall in front of them. The pick penetrated only a few inches before stopping abruptly. When they wrenched it out again, the head was badly bent

The Auditor's breath caught in his throat as the workers pulled back the thin veneer of rock and dirt, revealing a glimmering silver mass behind, untouched by the impact of the pick.

“Foreman Veinhunter”, he said in a small voice, full of barely suppressed excitement." is this what I think it is.”

“Aye, indeed it is. Finest blessings of the goddess in this holy earth”

“So this is why the tunnel was so long. But please tell me, how did you know this was here.”

“Kilmorph told me.” Reorx said with a smile

And so, Auditor Akrus carried the news back to Kazak, riding a heavily laden cart full of evidence to show to his superiors. Reorx Veinhunter had rewards and titles heaped upon him in abundance, all the empire's available resources at his command, as an army of dwarven workers filled and expanded his new mine. For he had found the largest known vein of Mithril in all of Erebus, and secured the prosperity of Khazak for generations to come.</English>

		<English>The Elohim merchant vessel had been almost too easy to capture. The pirate vessel had snuck up on them silently in the mist, wrecking their mast with the first broadside before the merchants even knew they where in danger. Pirates grinned as they drew alongside and readied grappling hooks – the merchant crew screamed and ran into their cabins in senseless terror.

The captain came on board personally with the first wave. A woman had been spotted fleeing into the main cabin, and the captain liked to claim such prizes personally. His crew dispersed below decks to ferret out the fleeing merchant cowards that had abandoned their posts. The captain kicked down the door with a fearsome and bellowing laugh that he reserved for inspire terror in his prisoners. Stretched out on the desk of the main cabin was, indeed, a woman's dress, but it was empty. Just then a call came out from behind him.

"Captain! The mast!"

"What about it?" He bellowed.

"It's armor plated! It only fell over because it's on a hinge!"

The captain's heart fell at those words. Courage turned to fear as he suddenly noticed that none of his men had yet returned from the lower decks. He opened his mouth to call for a retreat, but was silenced by the feel of cold steel against his throat. He turned his head, slowly and carefully, and saw the man who had hidden in the rafters above the door. His hair was long and grey, but he moved with a grace unusual for his age. He spoke with a dignified and cultured accent, gained from the years he had spent as a spice trader on the mainland.

"I am Captain Mordmorgan. Your men appear to be trespassing, a crime that bears serious penalties on the high seas. I do hope you and your crew know how to swim... it is two miles to the nearest island."

Mordmorgan was a kind man, at least in comparison to others in his chosen profession: he left the pirates with enough barrels to stay afloat until land. He watched them recede into the mist for a moment, then turned to his first mate.

"How many were willing to swear off a life of crime and commit to penance?"

"Only four, captain, this was a rough lot we caught today."

"All the better that they are off the seas, then. How is my ship?"

"The Stolen Thunder has a few dings on her, but nothing serious. We picked up more than enough scrap to repair her before we scuttled the pirates. That mast plating took a direct hit, but there's nary a scratch on it. How you talked the dwarves out of it I'll never know."

"Trade secret, my friend, you know that. Were there any serious injuries among the crew?"

"One man took a nasty blow to his arm, but the doctor has him patched up just fine. Everyone else is ready to go."

"Bring up the Malakim flag next – there's a fleet five days to the north heading for one of their colonies. We'll play the straggler and see who bites."</English>

    <English>"We have something special to show you today, Madam Ambassador."[PARAGRAPH]"Do you now?  I'd call the whole city "special," Commander Daeki.  And please, call me Elizabeth."[PARAGRAPH]Elizabeth DeCardin had been in the Scion city for over a month, and her words were not entirely empty flattery.  Having left Cevedes braced for horrors, only the portion of the journey through the haunted lands had been at all disquieting.  Of course the Scions were putting on a show for her, and she had far from free-access in this military town... but still, it was all far more pleasant than she'd expected.  Commander Daeki himself was probably the most disagreeable aspect of the city.  Scarred and horned, the Patrian officer looked more like a demon than the civilized, urbane soldier she'd become familiar with.  Nothing but a show.  She thought the Scion habit of making their military men all look like monsters was a bit childish, to tell the truth.  Not that she would.[PARAGRAPH]Daeki led the Amurite ambassador to a walkway overlooking a large courtyard.  Bleachers placed along one side of the yard held a crowd of civilian Patrians, with some richly dressed dignitaries on a special platform to the side.  A mix of both civilian and military dignitaries, Elizabeth could easily see.  The civilians possessed the uncanny beauty of all "Gifted" Patrians, while a few were the usual military horror show.  Several rows of armed and armored warriors faced the crowd.  Heavy infantry, it seemed.  Probably a unit of the Empire's "Principes".  They lacked heads, of course, though their commanding officer did not.  The ambassador had seen enough headless troops within the castle find them unexceptional.  Along with the officer, a couple of priests and a woman who was probably a mage stood before the warriors.  There was what looked to be a large number of small boxes piled neatly behind the priests.[PARAGRAPH]"A military ceremony, I presume?  Awards?"[PARAGRAPH]"Something like that, Madam Ambassador.  Here, they're beginning."[PARAGRAPH]One of the military men on the platform started addressing the crowd, praising the soldiers for their honor and courage.  All the usual blather.  Daeki related an incident in Avitas he'd just read in a letter.  A Lanun trader had bet he could out-drink a Scion trader, each drinking the other's preferred beverage.[PARAGRAPH]"The disagreement was about relative capacities, Madam Ambassador."[PARAGRAPH]Apparently the Scion trader had suffered some embarrassing damage from over-filling his stomach with brandy.  The Lanun trader, however, had worse luck with the Spirit Essence wine of the Scions.  Elizabeth chortled at the story's conclusion.[PARAGRAPH]"Haunted by little pink sheep and pigs?  Commander, you don't believe a word if it, I hope.  You've already told me of the tall-tales your great-grandson sends you.  I would have thought a judge would look more to his respectability.[PARAGRAPH]Daeki just smiled and shrugged, then said "Here, they're starting."[PARAGRAPH]Down in the courtyard a priest was handed one of the small boxes by his companion.  Then the priest and the mage stepped up to the first of the soldiers standing at attention.  When the priest opened the box's lid the mage reached in and drew from it... a man's head.[PARAGRAPH]"It's his own head, of course," volunteered Commander Daeki.  "They number the boxes quite carefully, I assure you.  Besides, the magic won't work right with the wrong head."[PARAGRAPH]Moving carefully, the mage settled the head onto the shoulders of the soldier, paused for a moment with her hands to either side of the head, and then stepped back.  The soldier suddenly raised his sword and shouted "For the Emperor!"  "For the Emperor!" the onlookers shouted back.[PARAGRAPH][PARAGRAPH]As the ceremony progressed, each soldier receiving his head in turn, Commander Daeki explained:[PARAGRAPH]"Our extrasensory magics turn what would be a severe handicap for many - headlessness - into a net asset", he dryly began.  "But a unit spearheading an attack often wants its senses at their sharpest at the battle. Not in Urbis Arcana.  So sometimes a picked unit will have their heads restored when in service rather than at decommissioning.  You do realize that decommissioned soldiers receive their heads back, yes?"[PARAGRAPH]"I had assumed as much.  Or on promotion to... Captain, yes?"[PARAGRAPH]"Of course, Madam Ambassador.  I should expect you to be well informed."[PARAGRAPH]Each soldier shouted when his head was reattached, and those who'd been restored before joined the audience in echoing him.  Elizabeth became aware that the heads were not opening their eyes only after being reattached.  And by watching carefully she determined the eyes of the unattached heads were not locked forward, as she had first assumed.  Instead they merely stared forward.  Like good soldiers on parade.[PARAGRAPH]"Well, this Urbis Arcana isn't something I'm familiar with."[PARAGRAPH]Daeki laughed.  "We usually just call it "Box city" or "The Four Walls Resort."  Soldiers are given the best drink, and treated to entertainments such as music, dancing, plays... you know... and duty permitting.  Anything you just need your head for, they can take part in.  Even out in the field.  It's a huge boon for morale, let me tell you."[PARAGRAPH]"I can imagine."[PARAGRAPH]"Still, being "capitaled" is considered a great honor.  It means the Emperor deems you worthy of leading the armies of Patria on the march, in the attack.  The vanguard of conquest... ex-cetera ex-cetera.  If you've seen enough....?  I know her Highness the governor wants to see you.[PARAGRAPH]As Commander Daeki turned to leave Elizabeth stayed looking on the courtyard below, attention focused not on the soldiers but on what Daeki had just said.  "May I ask where the soldiers below are normally stationed?"[PARAGRAPH]Daeki didn't turn to face her again, but shrugged and waved one had dismissively.  "Somewhere over on your border, I believe.  Now, come with me, please.  I think her Highness has some questions for you about the treaty."[PARAGRAPH]Elizabeth followed, thinking that Scion shows weren't invariably empty.</English>
    <French>"We have something special to show you today, Madam Ambassador."[PARAGRAPH]"Do you now?  I'd call the whole city "special," Commander Daeki.  And please, call me Elizabeth."[PARAGRAPH]Elizabeth DeCardin had been in the Scion city for over a month, and her words were not entirely empty flattery.  Having left Cevedes braced for horrors, only the portion of the journey through the haunted lands had been at all disquieting.  Of course the Scions were putting on a show for her, and she had far from free-access in this military town... but still, it was all far more pleasant than she'd expected.  Commander Daeki himself was probably the most disagreeable aspect of the city.  Scarred and horned, the Patrian officer looked more like a demon than the civilized, urbane soldier she'd become familiar with.  Nothing but a show.  She thought the Scion habit of making their military men all look like monsters was a bit childish, to tell the truth.  Not that she would.[PARAGRAPH]Daeki led the Amurite ambassador to a walkway overlooking a large courtyard.  Bleachers placed along one side of the yard held a crowd of civilian Patrians, with some richly dressed dignitaries on a special platform to the side.  A mix of both civilian and military dignitaries, Elizabeth could easily see.  The civilians possessed the uncanny beauty of all "Gifted" Patrians, while a few were the usual military horror show.  Several rows of armed and armored warriors faced the crowd.  Heavy infantry, it seemed.  Probably a unit of the Empire's "Principes".  They lacked heads, of course, though their commanding officer did not.  The ambassador had seen enough headless troops within the castle find them unexceptional.  Along with the officer, a couple of priests and a woman who was probably a mage stood before the warriors.  There was what looked to be a large number of small boxes piled neatly behind the priests.[PARAGRAPH]"A military ceremony, I presume?  Awards?"[PARAGRAPH]"Something like that, Madam Ambassador.  Here, they're beginning."[PARAGRAPH]One of the military men on the platform started addressing the crowd, praising the soldiers for their honor and courage.  All the usual blather.  Daeki related an incident in Avitas he'd just read in a letter.  A Lanun trader had bet he could out-drink a Scion trader, each drinking the other's preferred beverage.[PARAGRAPH]"The disagreement was about relative capacities, Madam Ambassador."[PARAGRAPH]Apparently the Scion trader had suffered some embarrassing damage from over-filling his stomach with brandy.  The Lanun trader, however, had worse luck with the Spirit Essence wine of the Scions.  Elizabeth chortled at the story's conclusion.[PARAGRAPH]"Haunted by little pink sheep and pigs?  Commander, you don't believe a word if it, I hope.  You've already told me of the tall-tales your great-grandson sends you.  I would have thought a judge would look more to his respectability.[PARAGRAPH]Daeki just smiled and shrugged, then said "Here, they're starting."[PARAGRAPH]Down in the courtyard a priest was handed one of the small boxes by his companion.  Then the priest and the mage stepped up to the first of the soldiers standing at attention.  When the priest opened the box's lid the mage reached in and drew from it... a man's head.[PARAGRAPH]"It's his own head, of course," volunteered Commander Daeki.  "They number the boxes quite carefully, I assure you.  Besides, the magic won't work right with the wrong head."[PARAGRAPH]Moving carefully, the mage settled the head onto the shoulders of the soldier, paused for a moment with her hands to either side of the head, and then stepped back.  The soldier suddenly raised his sword and shouted "For the Emperor!"  "For the Emperor!" the onlookers shouted back.[PARAGRAPH][PARAGRAPH]As the ceremony progressed, each soldier receiving his head in turn, Commander Daeki explained:[PARAGRAPH]"Our extrasensory magics turn what would be a severe handicap for many - headlessness - into a net asset", he dryly began.

[PARAGRAPH:1]  [PARAGRAPH:1] "A swirling fog [PARAGRAPH:1] A hidden mist [PARAGRAPH:1] Ghost writhe within it [PARAGRAPH:1] Souls long forgotten [PARAGRAPH:1] Dance along it [PARAGRAPH:1] Sadness composes it [PARAGRAPH:1] And I walk amongst it" [PARAGRAPH:1] -J.M.</Spanish>

Yet, when a group of hunters happened across a nearly-dead elven man freezing in the wastes, they took him back to their village and agreed to tend to his injuries rather than kill him. When he awoke in their care, he explained that he was Varn Gosam, and that he had fled from his homeland. Sensing some truth in him, the Malakim believed him and allowed him to live among them.[PARAGRAPH:1]Varn built a shrine to Lugus in the small village and began spreading his newfound religion to the villagers. His revival spread quickly, and the former elven prince found himself a leader of men. Accepting that role, he set forth to lead the Malakim through the hard years to follow and into the light of Lugus.[NEWLINE][TAB]
		The Malakim gain many bonuses related to deserts. They cannot build roads but can trade over desert terrain without the need of roads. The mounted units of the Malakim gain increased movement and withdrawal if they start their turn in desert and recon units gain invisibilty if they start their turn in the desert.

Yet, when a group of hunters happened across a nearly-dead elven man freezing in the wastes, they took him back to their village and agreed to tend to his injuries rather than kill him. When he awoke in their care, he explained that he was Varn Gosam, and that he had fled from his homeland. Sensing some truth in him, the Malakim believed him and allowed him to live among them.[PARAGRAPH:1]Varn built a shrine to Lugus in the small village and began spreading his newfound religion to the villagers. His revival spread quickly, and the former elven prince found himself a leader of men. Accepting that role, he set forth to lead the Malakim through the hard years to follow and into the light of Lugus.[NEWLINE][TAB]
		The Malakim gain many bonuses related to deserts. They cannot build roads but can trade over desert terrain without the need of roads. The mounted units of the Malakim gain increased movement and withdrawal if they start their turn in desert and recon units gain invisibilty if they start their turn in the desert.

        <English>When the dusk had come, every people in the city was afraid. Sheaim army was already at their gate. Necromancers, pyromancers and various members of Sheaim magical sects were in the army. No one doubted that the Sheaim army were very enthusiastic in entering the city.

Thus the fear, and hopelessness.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The city were manned by strong soldiers, but the Sheaim employed deadly magics. Even the strongest warrior would fall in the face of tremendous magic. And each fallen comrade would be arisen by the necromancers as new enemy. There was no hope, since steel and muscle could not defeat magic and sorcery.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The old Prior could taste the fear. Even when his eyes no longer see, he could feel it tangible in the air. He was old. He was neither warrior or mage. He was not capable of helping his fellow townsmate in the front line. Thus, he did the only thing he can do; he knelt down by the altar, and started to pray.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Unbeknown to him, his act of praying was followed by everyone in the chapel. Women and children, priests and laymen. All who were unable to bear weapon and face the enemy were gathered in the chapel. All felt the despair, the terror.

Their conjurers fired deadly magics. Their summoners called terrible beasts. Their necromancers waited, ready to bind dead bodies under their unholy command. On the defender side, all warriors raised their weapon. The war priests chanted blessings. The medics waited, ready to fight death using all of their skills.

        <English>The situation was dire. Naggarond had fallen to Hippus' advaced cavalry. At the same time, Lanun's corsairs were approaching waters near Kwythellar. This was more than bad, since all Kuriotates main armies were too busy fighting the Calabim in the west. There would be no time for the armies to go east, and arrive in time to save Kwythellar.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Seh-Tassehk was furious with herself. The alliance between Hippus and Lanun had been foreseeable, but their involvement in Kuriotates-Calabim war had been not. Her diplomats had been sure, that both Hippus and Lanun were satisfied with bribe provided by Kuriotates government. Alas, the mercenaries and pirates were more greedy than her diplomats had tought![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Your Majesssty." Seh-Tassehk slithered into the throne room. She bowed deeply to the Boy-King of Kuriotates.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Lady," Cardith Lorda acknowledged his diplomatic advisor and motioned her to come forward. "The situation is dire, I believe."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Yesss, Your Majesssty." Seh-Tassehk bowed again. "I am terribly sssorry for my failuresss."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cardith Lorda patted her fingers. An assurance which did nothing to lighten the burden in Seh-Tassehk's heart. "Do not worry, Lady. Not all is lost. We are not alone in this war. I just met an angelic messenger Lady Ethne had sent. She told me that the Elohim were praying for a miracle to lighten our burden. I believe in her, and in our patron. Lugus will not abandon us and let the realm of Kuriotates be swallowed by terrible darkness."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Seh-Tassehk bowed her head. She understood the Boy-King's deep faith in Lugus and the Empyreans. She herself found the faith attractive, and considered to convert sometime in the future. But she could not fathom, what kind of miracle would be able to save them. Not to mention, the Elohim was too far for sending direct reinforcements, angelic or not.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The enemies were approaching. Lanun's corsairs were visible in the coastline. Seh-Tassehk was preparing her fireball spell, when suddenly a bright light erupted in the sky. Cries were heard from the pirate's fleets, but none of Kuriotates' soldiers were hurt by the light.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"That is Lugus' Answer to ours and our ally's prayers." Cardith Lorda solemnly said. "Their sights and movements will be impaired by the searing light. It is our time to launch an attack! Prepare all of your Lamias, Lady.
