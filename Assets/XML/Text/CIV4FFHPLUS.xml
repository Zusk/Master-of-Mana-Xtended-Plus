        <English>While other empires' mages are cloistered up in guilds that have limited access to and from the outside world, Amurite wizards are more than welcome to share their knowledge with their fellow citizens.  This change in view is due to both the actions of Kylorin and the example of Govannon.  The Wizard's Hall is open to all Amurites, meaning any citizen of the empire could pick something up.  It also serves the same purposes as a mage's guild - training adepts to go out into the world.</English>

        <Spanish>Mientras los magos de otros imperios están enclaustrado en grenios que tienen aceso mínimo al mundo exterior, magos Amuritos son recibido con mucho agrado en compartir su conocimiento con sus compatriotas. Este cambio es a cause de las acciones de Kylorin y también el ejemplo de Govannon. El Auditorio de Brujos está abierto a todos los Amuritos, así cualquiera compatriota del imperio puede aprender algo. También cumple el mismo utilidad de un gremio de magos - enseñar a los adeptos para ir al mundo.</Spanish>

        <English>As the election grows near, disputes have broken out in the Senate. One group favours an aggressive foreign policy and suggests war against old rivals. The other advocates a more diplomatic approach and concentration of forces for defense only. Whichever side gains the most support will shape the senate for the coming term.</English>

        <English>The senate is divided. Several popular senators have recently criticized the lack of education amongst the working class, leading to some heated rebuttals. Those senators supporting the interests of the workers argue that without the sweat and blood of those workers, the empire would be nothing. The two sides have become deadlocked whenever funds must be divided between the workers or the intellectuals. Hopefully the results of the election will free the senate to act.</English>

		<English>Today's battle with Fadious was epic&#59; few could have survived the wounds
		inflicted on Lucian.  But Lucian had to be strong or some upstart pup would challenge him.  The
		march to Illian lands will be hard, and he would only have one night to lick his wounds.  With
		camp set, Lucian retired to his bear pelt tent.  The vomit could not be held back any longer and
		with a great purge every wound on his body opened filling the room with the stench of blood and
		bile. His strength gone and the world spinning, Lucian passed out.  Dreams of victory, loss,
		blood, gore, riches all filled his head and a voice range out, "You will die tonight - your battles will be in vain."  Lucian could not respond. "I can save you", the voice said, "but the price itself may get you killed". Lucian did not care; he was dying anyway. With one thought he agreed to the voice's unknown terms. "I am Cold Iron, forged by the god of winter, slayer of
		thousands. The weapon you have defiled with your blood and bile will bind your wounds and consume half
		of your soul."  Lucian awakened bathed in his own juices, but there were no wounds; however, a
		deep weakness pulsed through him. He would have to be careful and hope a priest can restore some
		of his strength. Looking over at his axe, two points of blue light shown in the eye sockets of
		its skull, but no words would ever come forth from it again.

        <Spanish>La batalla con Fadioso hoy fue épica&#59; pocos pudiera sobrevivir las heridas
		infligidas a Lucian. Pero Lucian tenía que quedarse fuerte o algún avenedizo le lanzaría desafío. La
		marcha a la tierra de los Ilianos será difícil, y tendría solamente una noche para lamerse las heridas. Con
		la campa hecha, Lucian se retiró a su tienda de piel de oso. No podía contenir el vómito y
		con un gran purgo cada herida de su cuerpo se abrió, llenando el cuarto co el hediondez de sangre y
		bilis. Su fuerza perdido y el mundo dándole vueltas, Lucian se desmayó. Sueños de victorias, pérdidas,
		sangre, y riquezas llenaron su cabeza y una voz resonó, "Usted se morirá esta noche - sus batallas están en vanos." Lucian no podía responder. "Puedo salvarle," la voz dijo, "pero el precio puede matarle." A Lucian no importó; estaba muriendo en todo caso. Con un pensado estaba de acuerdo con los termos desconocidos de la voz. "Soy Hierro Frío, forjado por el dios del invierno, matador de
		miles. El arma que has manchado con su sangre y bilis vendará sus heridas y consumirá una mitad
		de su alma." Lucian se despertó bañado en sus propios jugos
