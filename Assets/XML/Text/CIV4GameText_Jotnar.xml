		<English>Jotnar are the giant kin, an assortment of races that is held together by a common ancestry and traditions. They live centred around small family groups called 'Steaddings' or 'Homestaeds', not seldom attracting some odd kin to their dwellings. Hill giants, Trolls, Fiery giants, Tritons of the sea .. even the mightiest of them - the Titans - might fall in under their banners once they unraveled the mystery of immortality. Tightly held together, slow to bear offspring and to come to action, their pure size make them a force to be considered.[NEWLINE]STRATEGY: Cities will only use the first grid around it, instaed of two. This greatly influence the placement of cities. They can also never grow bigger then size eight, so aim for many small cities. The Civic 'Traditions' aid in this by reducing the maintnance cost for number of cities. Jotnar units are not built, they are born (exceptions are workers, settlers, thrall militia and some naval units). A rare and slow breed you are dependant on the emergence of new Jotnar Children and Adults, the citizens can then be upgraded into most units you need. Even settlers. And Jotnar Citizens can work the fields and break new roads while waiting to put them in use. They also slowly gains experience, so their time as Citizens are not wasted. The Jotnar can build a unique wonder after discovery of Code of Laws and Masonry that is called the Wall of the Covenant, and which holds the Barbarians at bay. A very useful wonder on maps with large landmass and active/agressive barbarians. To make sure that your units are not wasted (since you cannot massproduce them like other civilizations) build House of the Ancestors early in all cities, it gives your units the Spirit Guide promotion which gives some experience back to your other units when a unit dies.[NEWLINE]WAR: While Jotnar often cannot produce a massive amount of units in a short time, often hindered by an average of 1 units each twenty turns even with an unlimited supply of gold, they -are- giants. Many of Jotnar units are a little stronger then their normal counterparts, they ignore terrain and can often cross even mountains that allow them to attack from unexpected directions. They also do not need bring siege-machines, because each giant in himself can tear down a wall or two. Even the Jotnar Workers can bombard cities. For the devious one, Jotnar have the Hill Giants, whom can be mass produced with Hidden Nationality, often making it hard for even other players to determine if they are your units or are the real thing.</English>
