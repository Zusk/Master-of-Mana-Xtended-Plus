		<English>The Unblemished are descended from the Age of Magic church of Sucellus. Over the centuries the Unblemished's worship of Sucellus has become all-pervasive, but rarely explicit. The Age of Ice and the death of their god left scars on the Unblemished. They were long a hidden people, watching and guarding the great ice shards that marked their god's defeat.[PARAGRAPH:1]They did not lose hope, but to speak of Sucellus or to engage in his rites was too painful. Yet as best they could the Unblemished maintained his precept. They nursed small sheltered gardens, shared their scant seed with the birds, and husbanded the starving wildlife of the frozen forests.  Their work came to little and despite great efforts, notably new and powerful enchantments, they steadily diminished. But they persevered. And they never forgot Sucellus.[PARAGRAPH:1]Too exhausted to stage grand ceremonies they worked the Rites of Sucellus into their everyday lives. Small religious competitions and tests, awards, and organized sports and games--all dedicated to Sucellus--became inextricably linked to their way of life... as meager as it had become. They silently held to hope, learning to heal and maintain what little they had rather than find their joy in Nature's infinite variations. And in time the long struggle with the deathly cold, the hostile tribes, and the death of their deity became worthy for its own sake. Perseverance against insurmountable odds had become a way of life, and the Unblemished exulted in it.[PARAGRAPH:1][PARAGRAPH:1]The Unblemished are the persevering faithful. They not only refused to give up on their god, but they followed his change of precept. Perhaps even anticipated it. With Sucellus' resurrection at the beginning of the Age of Rebirth the Unblemished believe they have received their reward. Blessed by both the new God of Life and a rejoicing Nantosuelta, the Unblemished are ready to take back Erebus from the forces of evil.  They will make the next age the final one, the Age of Glory.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Unblemished are an energetic culture, not so much aggressive militarily as they are extremely ambitious. Most consider themselves part of a chosen people destined lead Erebus. But only when they deserve it: The Unblemished know they, like the world, are faulty. Victory and peace will come only with hard work and by striving always for perfection.</English>

		<English>Paramount Enchantress and High-Priestess of Nantosuelta.  The Unblemished have multiple informal ranks acknowledging a person's achievement, and Drimhela is the second youngest "Apothearch" in Unblemished history.  One of the greatest living Enchantresses, she looks even younger.  Affecting a demure air in public, her razor-like gaze is the only hint of the unmatched ambition concealed by that soft manner.  Drimhela is a leader of the Bridgit Sect, who seek a way to elevate the archangel to godhood.  She has not sought to make the Sect's goals part of the main Rites, but she does expect every Unblemished mage to share her skill with Fire magic.[PARAGRAPH:1]Drimhela favors the Inward Strategy, focusing Unblemished efforts within their own lands and building as strong a civilization as possible.</English>

		<English>Warrior, mage, priestess, next to Apothearch Drimhela Obbaern is probably the most powerful Unblemished.  A skilled if not renowned enchantress, she is truly pious in the worship of Sucellus and Nantosuelta.  The youngest Apothearch in history, she early abandoned temple and ruling to serve in the army, quickly rising to Paragon.  Paragon Coldine himself has called her the Unblemished's most gifted strategist.  Now at Drimhela's personal request Obbaern has forsaken field command and accepted a civil position in the capital, where she is quickly becoming the most influential Minister.  Much to Drimhela's dismay, it is rumored, as the Paramount and High-Priestess may have pulled Obbaern from the military in an attempt to check the Paragon's ascendancy.[PARAGRAPH:1]Obbaern favors the Outward Strategy, believing that only in fully engaging with the rest of Erebus may the Unblemished reach their full potential.</English>

[ICON_BULLET]Iconoclast Great Person Event: An Iconoclast consumes 80% of the civilization's Vim.  Only above 100 Vim.  Very high Vim makes an Iconoclast more likely.

		<Spanish>[H1]Unblemished Vim[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Vim represents the Unblemished's vitality and perseverance. Their energy and determination. "Vim" can help the civ pull together in times of adversity or split it apart on the verge of victory, when powerful and driven Unblemished differ on how to seal thier victory... or just become complacent.[PARAGRAPH:1]When Vim is too low the Unblemished become discontent with your rule and cities may temporarily revolt. If Vim goes below 0 the whole civilization may fall into Anarchy for a time, but will emerge with renewed Vim. If Vim becomes too high an Iconoclast Great Person may rise from among the people and attempt to re-direct the civilization's efforts. Even "healthy" levels of Vim can see cities falling into complacency. Vim will rise and fall throughout the game. Sometimes via your actions, and sometimes pop-up Events will demonstrate that your citizens - determined folk that they are - will act on their own.[PARAGRAPH:1]You start with 100 Vim. A symbol in the upper left will call your attention to the Vim display. "Unblemished Vim" is how many Vim points you currently have. The % number after the slash is the base chance for each city to fall into revolt.[PARAGRAPH:1][PARAGRAPH:1]All gains and losses have a message or pop-up except for unit loss and population gain.[PARAGRAPH:1]
