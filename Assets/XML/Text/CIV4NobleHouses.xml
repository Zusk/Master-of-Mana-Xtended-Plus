        <German>Der Handel zwischen den verschiedenen Reichen hat inzwischen so gewaltige Ausmaße angenommen, dass das Verschiffen der benötigten Goldmünzen mehr Schiffe benötigen würde, als selbst die Lanun bereitstellen könnten. Haus Kundarak leitet die größte Bank, die Erebus jemals gesehen hat. Durch die Ausgabe von Pfandbriefen und der Möglichkeit solche Briefe in fast beliebiger Menge einzulösen wurde die moderne Lebensart erst möglich und dies hat Haus Kundarak sehr, sehr reich gemacht.</German>
